This paper surveys and discusses the application of data-derived soft-sensing techniques in biological
wastewater treatment plants. Emphasis is given to an extensive overview of the current status and to the
specic challenges and potential that allow for an effective application of these soft-sensors in full-scale
scenarios. The soft-sensors presented in the case studies have been found to be effective and inexpensive
technologies for extracting and modelling relevant process information directly from the process and
laboratory data routinely acquired in biological wastewater treatment facilities. The extracted information is in the form of timely analysis of hard-to-measure primary process variables and process diagnostics that characterize the operation of the plants and their instrumentation. The information is
invaluable for an effective utilization of advanced control and optimization strategies.

1. Introduction
During the recent decades, the increased awareness about the
negative impact of eutrophication in the quality of water bodies
(see, e.g., Ansari et al., 2010) and the advances in environmental
technology have given rise to more stringent wastewater treatment
requirements and regulations (Olsson et al., 2005; Olsson, 2012). In
wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), the tightening treatment
regulations are leading towards the addition of new unit processes
and towards the renewal of the existing ones. A typical example in
municipal WWTPs is the update of the ammonia removal process
towards total nitrogen removal; this is usually achieved through
the conversion of the biological reactor from a single aerated tank
to a sequence of anoxic and aerobic zones. The subsequent increase
in operational and management investments, mostly associated to
energy consumption and chemical dosing, stimulates modern
WWTPs to face the challenges of maintaining and improving
efuent quality, while guaranteeing efcient and safe operations
and optimizing the costs. A major requirement for achieving these
goals relies on the availability of real-time measurements of key or
primary process indicators. These indicators are needed to efciently monitor the operation of the plants in terms of inuent and

efuent quality, process and instrument performance and economic efciency, with immediate implications for environmental
compliance, safety, management planning and protability. The
real-time availability of primary indicators is invaluable for an
effective utilization of advanced process control and optimization
strategies in WWTPs.
The conventional approach to the monitoring problem in
WWTPs relies upon on-line and off-line analysis of the primary
variables. The primary variables are typically concentrations of
ammonia, nitrates and total nitrogen, phosphates and total phosphorus, suspended solids, biochemical and chemical oxygen demand, as well as others process variables like the sludge blanket
level. Such variables are hard-to-measure and their availability is
often associated with expensive capital and maintenance costs, as
well as being characterized by time-delayed responses that are
often unsuitable for real-time monitoring. For instance, the organic
compounds are still typically monitored by off-line laboratory
measurements, of which the analysis of biochemical oxygen demand requires several days. Moreover, the harsh conditions in
biological treatment processes such as the Activated Sludge Process
(ASP) make reliable eld measurements challenging. Already in an
early survey where fty wastewater treatment facilities in the USA
were considered (Molvar et al., 1976) and in a publication on the
state-of-the-art in wastewater treatment control (Olsson, 1977), the
problems of on-line instrumentation were discussed. The typical
problems included solids deposition, slime build-up and precipitation, which gave rise to poor performance and a frequent need for

H. Haimi et al. / Environmental Modelling & Software 47 (2013) 88e107

maintenance of the instrumentation. During the recent decades,
considerable development in on-line instrumentation has taken
place (see e.g., Vanrolleghem and Lee, 2003; Olsson, 2012). In spite
of the recent advances, such as in situ nutrient sensors and luminescent dissolved oxygen sensors, instruments still tend to get
fouled (Olsson, 2012). Nevertheless, trustworthy real-time analyses
for many key variables is not there yet.
Due to the progress in measurement, automation and communication technologies, WWTPs are also becoming highly instrumented and many on-line easy-to-measure process variables are
routinely acquired. The easy-to-measure or secondary variables are
typically pressure, temperature, ow rate, and level measurements,
as well as conductivity, turbidity, pH, and, perhaps dissolved oxygen. The secondary variables can be extensively used for characterizing the operational conditions of the unit processes and they
offer an inexpensive opportunity to extract primary information
useful to monitor both the processes and the instruments. For
example, being the primary variables necessarily related to some of
the secondary variables, their availability offers the opportunity to
develop process models capable to reconstruct such a relationship
and thus also to estimate the primary variables. Such models are at
the core of virtual instruments often referred to as software- or
soft-sensors; that is, computer programs that model the input information encoded in the secondary variables and output information related to the primary variables, in a similar fashion to their
hardware counterparts (Kadlec et al., 2009). On the basis of their
internal model, soft-sensors are often divided into two main classes, phenomenological and data-driven. Phenomenological softsensors are based on the rst principle process models, whereas
data-driven soft-sensors are built around process models derived
from data. Hybrid soft-sensors combine these two modelling
approaches.
In wastewater treatment, the most commonly used rst principle models belong to the Activated Sludge Model (ASM) family
(Henze et al., 2000) proposed by the IWA Task Group on Mathematical Modelling for Design and Operation of Biological Wastewater Treatment. Moreover, the IWA Task Group on Good
Modelling Practice has created a unied protocol for enhancing the
quality of activated sludge modelling and dealing with uncertainties associated with the phenomenological approaches
(Rieger et al., 2012). Because capable to describe both linear and
nonlinear phenomena and to provide information on the internal
states of the process, the detailed phenomenological modelling
approach has proven to be efcient, for example, in wastewater
treatment process design, renovation, employee training, optimization of the plant operation and understanding the systems
behaviour and interactions of the components (Hauduc et al., 2009;
Phillips et al., 2009). The ASM models have also been used in softsensor design, for instance by Sprandio and Queinnec (2004) and
Grau et al. (2007). However, there are major challenges in using the
rst principle models for real-time applications. For example,
characterizing the organic matter and determining the rate constants for the volatile fatty acid (VFA) uptake in wastewater is
challenging, expensive and time-consuming and, yet, fundamental
for successful model calibration (Dochain and Vanrolleghem, 2001;
Petersen et al., 2003; Sin, 2004; Hauduc et al., 2011). Moreover, the
high-dimensionality of detailed phenomenological models results
in an enormous computational requirements and ill-conditioned
problems due to the interaction between fast and slow dynamics
(Dochain and Vanrolleghem, 2001).
The large amount of process data routinely measured and
collected in modern WWTPs permits data-driven modelling as an
interesting alternative for soft-sensor design. A data-derived softsensor is an inputeoutput model, where the inputs usually consist of
easy-to-measure secondary variables in the form of plants signals.

89

In the soft-sensor, the input information is modelled and the internal model is used to return output information associated with
the hard-to-measure primary variables. Different families of models
have been popular in designing the data-derived soft-sensors,
which are commonly used for applications such as on-line prediction, process monitoring and process fault detection, and sensor
monitoring and reconstruction (Kadlec, 2009). Today, data-driven
soft-sensors are becoming more common in the wastewater treatment sector, even though they are still not as widespread as, for
instance, in the process industry where soft-sensors are extensively
exploited (see, e.g., Fortuna et al., 2007; Kadlec et al., 2009). Softsensors have also been used in the other environmental domains,
where the open distributed architectures for sensor networks
(Douglas et al., 2008) provide an increasing amount of the available
data. For instance, environmental data has been applied for softsensors aiming at real-time anomaly detection in the meteorological signals (Hill et al., 2009; Hill and Minsker, 2010) and at prediction of the ammonia concentration in a river downstream the
sewage and WWTP outlets (Masson et al., 1999). In the wastewater
treatment facilities, the data-derived soft-sensor applications range
from the proposals where a small number of variables are used for
modelling (such as in Marsili-Libelli, 1990; Lumley, 2002; Puig et al.,
2005; ijl and Lumley, 2006; Cecil and Kozlowska, 2010) to the
studies where a larger number of measurements are processed
together with a model (for instance, Teppola et al., 1999b; Rosen and
Lennox, 2001; Aguado et al., 2007a; Lee et al., 2008; Corona et al.,
2013), which in particular are in the scope of this review. Datadriven applications in wastewater treatment are included in
earlier review papers, where their extent, however, is limited. Their
limited amount is due to the main focus of these review publications
being on the application of phenomenological modelling (Yoo et al.,
2001; Gernaey et al., 2004; Banadda et al., 2011) or on the use of a
specic data-driven modelling family (Khataee and Kasiri, 2011;
Yetilmezsoy et al., 2011).
In this paper, we aim to provide an extensive overview of the
applications of data-derived soft-sensors in wastewater treatment
and to present a general guideline for the development of dataderived soft-sensors. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2
introduces briey the biological wastewater treatment process
types, which are used in the case studies, and characteristics of
WWTP operation data. In Section 3, we give an overview of the
practical steps to be undertaken in the design of data-derived softsensors. A review of publications focussing on the data-derived
soft-sensor applications in wastewater treatment systems is given
in Section 4. Next, Section 5 contains a discussion on our ndings
concerning the applications of the data-derived soft-sensors in
WWTPs and the current status and future challenges of softsensing in the eld of operation. A nomenclature of the terminology is provided in Table 1.
2. Wastewater treatment plants
Municipal wastewater treatment aims at reducing the amounts
of nutrients, organic matter (determined as Biochemical Oxygen
Demand (BOD), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) or Total Organic
Carbon (TOC)) and Suspended Solids (SS) that inuent wastewater
contains. This is typically carried out by using several unit processes, including biological, chemical and physical treatment
methods. The core of the treatment line is a biological reactor such
in the ASP, where a high concentration of activated sludge consisting mainly of bacteria and protozoa is recycled in zones with
different Dissolved Oxygen (DO) conditions, especially for nitrogen
removal purposes. In most of the municipal WWTPs, primary and
secondary clariers are applied for separation and thickening
sludge. To maintain the microbiological population in the

bioreactor, the sludge from the secondary clariers is recirculated
into the biological reactor. Phosphorus removal is typically achieved using chemical precipitation, but process congurations targeting for Enhanced Biological Phosphorus Removal (EBPR) also
exist. In the EBPR process, polyphosphate-accumulating organisms
are selectively enriched in the bacterial community and an additional anaerobic process stage and a more sophisticated sludge
recirculation scheme are required. In addition, anaerobic digestion
is a typical process for excess sludge treatment where the amount
of organic matter in the sludge is considerably reduced and the
biogas generated during the digestion process is often used for
producing electricity and heat.
Also in many industrial sectors, biological wastewater treatment
is widely applied. For instance in the pulp and paper industry, ASP
is the treatment process most commonly used (see, e.g., Thompson
et al., 2001; Pokhrel and Viraraghavan, 2004). Here, the whole
biological reactor is aerated, being the main goal of the treatment to
oxidize the high concentration of organic compounds in the
wastewater. Clariers are applied in the treatment lines in a similar
manner as in municipal facilities and, depending on the preceding
industrial processes, unit operations such as cooling towers and
equalization basins may be needed before the biological treatment.
Furthermore, the neutralization of the wastewater is often required
and nitrogen and phosphorus usually need to be dosed in the

biological WWTPs of pulp and paper industry in order to maintain a
sufcient balance between organic matter and the nutrients for the
microbiological population. In the reviewed papers, ASP is also
applied for the treatment of the wastewaters of other industrial
sectors in the majority of the case studies.
In addition to the ASP, also other kinds of treatment processes
have been used in the reviewed papers and they are briey
described. Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBRs) containing activated
sludge are operated in a different number of phases such as lling,
aeration, mixing, settling and decanting. The phases and their
lengths are determined depending on the treatment targets. In the
Membrane Bioreactors (MBRs), suspended solids are separated
with membranes instead of secondary clariers as in the conventional ASPs. Considerably larger Mixed Liquor Suspended Solids
(MLSS) concentrations can be used in the MBR due to getting rid of
the operational constraints set by the clarier units. Trickling lters
are aerobic processes, where wastewater ows through permeable
medium to which microorganisms are attached. The Moving Bed
Biolm Reactor (MBBR) technology is based on the carrier media
that provides a large protected surface area for the biolm
attachment and that moves freely in the bioreactor where wastewater is treated in. The aerated Submerged Biolm Reactors (SBFRs)
are lled with porous support medium through which wastewater
and air ow. Specically, the support medium on which biolm

H. Haimi et al. / Environmental Modelling & Software 47 (2013) 88e107

grows is maintained under the total immersion of the water ow in
the SBFRs. In the Lagoon Treatment Plants (LTPs), earthen basins are
used as reactors and typically they require a large surface area.
Floating surface aerators are used to provide the required oxygen
and mixing in the lagoons. In the Single reactor system for High
activity Ammonium Removal Over Nitrite (SHARON) process, partial nitrication, i.e. oxidation of ammonium to nitrite, is established. Nitrate formation in the reactor is prevented by adjusting
temperature, pH, and retention time and, thus, the aeration
requirement of SHARON is smaller in comparison with a conventional complete nitrication process.
Several types of bioreactors operated in anaerobic or anoxic
conditions have also been considered in the reviewed papers.
Anaerobic Digestion (AD) is the process where sewage is treated,
for instance, in septic tanks mainly for reducing the organic content
of wastewater. In the Upow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB)
process, wastewater is introduced at the bottom of the reactor and
it ows upwards through a sludge blanket composed of biologically
formed granules or particles in the absence of oxygen. Anaerobic
Filters (AFs) treat wastewater that is led through a bed of medium
on which anaerobic bacteria grows. Typically, their operation targets on the removal of organic matter but, for example, in anaerobic
post-treatment lters the goal may be reducing the nitrate content
in wastewater in the presence of an external carbon source. In the
Anaerobic Fluidized Bed Reactors (AFBRs), bacteria are immobilized
on small uidized medium though which wastewater ows and the
process is operated in an up-ow mode in order to achieve
uidization.
The process data of a municipal WWTP has typical diurnal and
seasonal trends, e.g., in inuent ow rate, concentrations and
temperature (Olsson et al., 2005). Also, differences in the wastewater composition between weekdays and weekends exist. In
addition to time-related trends, municipal WWTPs are exposed to
disturbances such as heavy rains and snow melt. In industrial
WWTP data, rapid and abrupt changes in the inuent temperature
and concentrations are often caused by the permutations in the
preceding industrial production process (Woodard & Curran, Inc.,
2006). Moreover, depending on the specic eld of industry, a
large variety of pollutants are commonly regulated (see, e.g., Water
Environment Federation, 2008) and, therefore, the analysis results
for the case-specic pollutants are available in the data stored in
the treatment plants.
Due to the demanding conditions in the biological WWTPs, the
real-time measured process data usually contains missing and
anomalous observations (Rosen, 2001; Olsson et al., 2005). The
reasons for missing observations include instrumentation malfunctions and maintenance, faults in the data transmission and errors in the database. Typical wastewater treatment operation data
also contains outliers, that is to say, inconsistent observations that
deviate markedly from the regular operation of the process and its
instrumentation. Additionally, drifting data can exist because of
process drifts caused, for example, by weather changes or sensor
drifts due to defective instruments. Under these circumstances,
back-up and fault detection systems for the hardware instrumentation as well as real-time predictions of the process variables are
benecial for ensuring the efcient operation of WWTPs.
3. Soft-sensor development
A data-derived soft-sensor is conventionally described as an
inputeoutput process model. The model inputs consist of easy-tomeasure secondary variables in the form of plants signals and
measurements and, sometimes, numerically encoded expert
knowledge. The model outputs consist of information associated
with the hard-to-measure primary variables. In the soft-sensor, the

91

input and output process information is modelled empirically and
the internal model is used to return the outputs when only the
inputs are available.
The range of tasks that can be fullled by data-derived softsensors is broad and mainly dictated by the nature of the available
input information, by the information that we are interested to
output and the typology of the inputeoutput model. The original
and still most prominent application area is the on-line prediction of
process variables that can be only measured either at low sampling
rates or off-line. In this case, the inputs are those variables that are
easy to measure and the outputs are estimates of the variables that
are hard to measure; since the inputeoutput relationship is encoded in the data used to calibrate the model, the soft-sensor model is
used to reconstruct it and then to estimate the output variables
when new inputs are available. At its core, this type of soft-sensors
addresses a supervised learning problem in the form of regression
or classication. The other typical application areas are related to
monitoring the state of the process and to monitoring the state of the
instrumentation. In this case, the inputs are again those variables
that are easy to measure and the outputs are information on the
operation of the process and the instruments, in the form of diagnostics and status characterization; since the output information
is usually hidden in the data, the soft-sensor model is used to
explore the data and then to estimate the outputs when new inputs
are available. At its core, this typology of soft-sensors usually addresses an unsupervised learning problem in the form of dimensionality reduction or clustering.
This section overviews the practical steps to be undertaken in
the design of data-derived soft-sensors. An overview is given in
Fig. 1 and the main steps along with the most commonly used
techniques are briey discussed. The procedure is general and it
does not refer to the design of specic types of soft-sensors or
specic applications thereof. Moreover, it is not unequivocally
standardized, though extensively adopted by both researchers and
practitioners (Kadlec, 2009). The procedure consists of several independent steps (data acquisition, data pre-processing, model design
and model maintenance) and it is to be understood as an iterative
process where choices made in the design often need to be
reconsidered before the soft-sensor is ready for deployment.
3.1. Data acquisition
In modern WWTPs, the historical process and laboratory data
are routinely acquired and stored in the data acquisition system of
the plant. The data can be easily retrieved and data collection and
subsequent data inspection are the rst steps in soft-sensor development. During the initial inspection, a preliminary exploration of
the measurements is performed, in order to overview the prominent structures in the data (e.g., redundancies, taxonomies, functionalities and time-delays existing between variables and
observations) and to identify the presence of obvious problems
(e.g., locked variables, missing and drifting data and measurements
outside the operating range of the instruments). In addition, periods of instrument calibrations and unit process maintenance are
also annotated together with a selection of representative operations (e.g., steady states and periodicities, transients and seasonal
disturbances). The inspection typically requires a large amount of
manual work and expertise in the underlying processes, coupled
with an extensive exploration of time series, scatter plots, and
histograms of data.
3.2. Data pre-processing
Remarkable characteristics of the data acquired in wastewater
treatment facilities are redundancy and possibly insignicance,

92

let alone the presence of other disturbances that corrupt the
measurements. Very often, the amount and quality of the data
together with their high-dimensionality can be a limiting factor for
the development of the soft-sensors. Therefore, it is necessary to
prepare the data before they are processed by the soft-sensors
model. Process understanding and a priori knowledge is required in
this phase; the plant operators and experts can provide valuable
information on the relevance of the variables and the observations.
Such a knowledge can be supported and complemented by many
statistical techniques for variable selection and sample selection. In
the following, some of the most commonly used techniques for
these tasks are briey overviewed.
3.2.1. Variable selection
The choice of the input variables that inuence the model
output is a crucial stage. Variable selection consists of choosing
those secondary variables that are most informative for the process
being modelled, as well as those that provide the highest generalization ability. This step is fundamental because data models are
built from a nite number of observations and having a model with
too many inputs and hence too many parameters, may lead to overtting and induce large computational times. In addition,
describing a process in terms of a few selected variables allows to
retain interpretability.
The most commonly used techniques for variable selection are
often categorized as ltering, wrapping and embedded methods
(Guyon and Elisseeff, 2003). Embedded methods perform the selection inside the soft-sensors model and they will be overviewed
in Section 3.3. Filters and wrappers select variables and subsets of
variables by ranking them on the basis of their signicance for the
task. The latter methods rely on the conjunction of two independent elements:
 a relevance criterion, to score an input variable or a group of
input variables according to its informative power;
 a search procedure, for nding among all the available variables
the subset that optimizes the chosen criterion.
The criterion is often based either on statistical dependence or
model accuracy measures. The simplest and most popular ways to
measure the interactions between sets of variables are correlation
and its multivariate extension obtained with Canonical Correlation
Analysis (Hotelling, 1936). Mutual information, on the other hand,
can be used to measure the total amount of linear and nonlinear
information (Kraskov et al., 2004). Less conventional relevance
criteria are noise variance (Liitiinen et al., 2009) and the generalization error of a model (Kohavi and John, 1997). Given a criterion,
the simplest strategy for variable selection consists of scoring all
inputs and rank them accordingly, then, a threshold is set and only

the variables that score more than the threshold are kept. Variable
ranking is the simplest and the fastest of all the methods. Exhaustive
search, conversely, is the most expensive procedure, for it performs
the scoring and ranking for each possible subset of variables. A
speed-complexity compromise is found in incremental and/or
decremental methods; such methods add and/or remove one variable at each iteration of the search and their procedure is halted
when there is no improvement in the criterion or, when a predened number of variables is already selected.
In many situations the computational applicability of criterionsearch schemes is limited by the too large number of inputs. An
alternative approach to reduce the dimensionality of the problem
consists of producing a small number of combinations of the
original variables. New variables may be constructed on the basis of
process knowledge (e.g., using balance calculations and averaging)
or they can be derived using statistical projection methods for
dimensionality reduction (Lee and Verleysen, 2007). Projection
methods aim at reducing the data dimensionality by mapping the
observations onto a low-dimensional subspace, in such a way that
certain properties of the data are preserved as faithfully as possible.
Linear multivariate techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA, Jolliffe, 2002) and Partial Least Squares (PLS, Wold et al.,
2001) are probably the most common methods for learning a lowdimensional representation of a set of data. PCA constructs new
variables that are maximally independent in a linear sense, hence
uncorrelated. PLS, on the other hand, constructs new variables that
are maximally uncorrelated among themselves and also maximally
linearly related with the output variable. The variables produced by
projection methods do not necessarily retain an explicit connection
with the original process variables and to regain interpretability on
the process being modelled, they are often used in combination
with contribution plots. Methods like PCA and PLS are most
commonly used for continuous processes. In the case of batch
processes, the multiway nature of the data is more appropriately
exploited using consistent extensions of the aforementioned linear
techniques (Smilde et al., 2004).
3.2.2. Sample selection
When analysing real data, it is not uncommon that some observations are different from the majority. Such observations are
often called outliers. They may be due to data acquisition mistakes
or they correspond to exceptional process circumstances and, in
general, one can distinguish between two main types of outliers: i)
obvious outliers are observations that violate physical or technological limitations and ii) non-obvious outliers are observations that
do not violate any bound but still lay out of typical ranges. Sample
selection consists of discarding or pinpointing outlying observations because not necessarily representative of normal operations
and because their use may be detrimental for the performances of

H. Haimi et al. / Environmental Modelling & Software 47 (2013) 88e107

the soft-sensor model (Rosen et al., 2003). Alternatively, sample
selection consists of choosing only those observations that are truly
representative of the normal operation of the processes and instruments being modelled.
A detailed multi-phase procedure for obtaining high-quality
WWTP data was recently proposed by Rieger et al. (2010) in a
study that offers guidelines starting from the experimental design
and the data collection phase. On already available data, multivariate statistical methods like the already mentioned PCA and PLS,
coupled with an analysis of model residuals like the Hotellings T2
and the Squared Prediction Error (SPE), or Q-statistic, are frequently
used (Robinson et al., 2005). Interestingly, however, also these
classical models are sensible to outliers in the data and to overcome
such a limitation, their robust extensions should be used instead
(Rousseeuw and Hubert, 2011). Again, such approaches are most
conveniently used for continuous processes, whereas multiway
variants are more suitable in the case of batch processes (Hubert
et al., 2012).
A conceptually different approach to sample selection can be
seen in the application of clustering and classication methods
(Hastie et al., 2009). Clustering and classication methods aim at
reducing the amount of data by grouping the observations into
subsets, either clusters or classes, consisting of similar observations. Similarity refers to the property where observations
belonging to a group should be as much as possible similar to each
other, but differ signicantly from observations in other groups.
Clustering is essentially an unsupervised learning problem,
whereas classication is the analogous supervised problem based
pre-labelled data. The most commonly used techniques for clustering are based on the K-means algorithm (Hartigan and Wong,
1979) and on Fuzzy C-means (FCM, Bezdek et al., 1984). Classication, on the other hand, is typically performed using methods
based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (Fisher, 1936) and on Articial Neural Networks (ANN, Haykin, 1999) and Support Vector
Machines (Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000).
3.3. Model design
Model design is a critical step in soft-sensor development, for
the structure of the model at the core denes the specic application task and it conrms the designers assumptions on the
problem being studied. Moreover, the selection of the model parameters determines the generalization abilities of the soft-sensor.
However, a consistent approach to the task does not exist so far and,
the model structure and its parameters are often selected in an ad
hoc manner for each soft sensor (Kadlec et al., 2009). This is rstly
due to the fact that model design depends on the task at hand and it
is often subjected to developers past experience and personal
preference, as many designers strongly focus on the one approach
in their eld of expertise.
Despite the lack of a theoretically superior approach to model
design, two main tasks can be recognized: i) model structure selection and ii) model training, calibration and testing. The common
practice suggests to start with simple model types, assess their
potential and performances and then gradually increase
complexity, as long as signicant improvements are observed.
Furthermore, it is important that the models are not only accurate,
but also simple and computationally efcient, interpretable and
with low maintenance cost. While performing the task it is
fundamental to optimize the model parameters in terms of
generalization performances, through a validation of the results on
independent data before testing the results. In the following the
main family of model structures are overviewed and then the
optimization of their parameters discussed using a standard
method like cross-validation.

3.3.1. Model structure selection
3.3.1.1. Models for on-line prediction. Such models address the
problem of reconstructing the functionality existing between the
easy-to-measure inputs and the hard-to-measure process outputs.
Usually, the inputs and the outputs take continuously varying real
values and their relationships can be modelled as a regression
problem. Less common is the case where the outputs take categorical values; in this case, their relationship can be modelled as a
classication problem. In the following we will focus only on the
most common regression models and we refer the reader interested on classication to the book by Duda et al. (2000).
The simplest regression techniques assume the existence of a
linear inputeoutput relationship and they t a linear model to
reconstruct it. Most of the commonly used techniques pertain to
multivariate statistics (Anderson, 2003) and they provide an interpretable description of how the inputs affect the output. Multiple
linear regression (MLR) is based on the ordinary least squares
approximation of the linear model, which is simple and sometimes
accurate. Accuracy and interpretability of MLR can be improved by
shrinking the regression coefcients and possibly setting some of
them to zero. This is achieved with linear regression models that
also perform an embedded variable selection scheme (Hastie et al.,
2009). The most commonly used subset selection methods are
Best Subset Selection, Forward and Backward Stepwise Selection,
Forward Stagewise Regression, whereas popular shrinking methods
are Ridge regression, the LASSO and the LARS. In situations with a
large number of inputs, multivariate statistical methods combining
linear projection and linear regression can be used to reduce the
dimensionality of the modelling problem, at the price of interpretability. The most commonly used in this category methods are
Principal Component Regression (PCR) and PLS regression.
Adaptive and recursive extensions of PCR and PLS (see e.g., Kadlec
et al., 2011) can be used for capturing the dynamic nature of process data, whereas nonlinear kernel extensions like KPCA and KPLS
(Rosipal and Trejo, 2001) can be used in the presence of
nonlinearities.
Other nonlinear methods do not necessarily rely on any
assumption on the inputeoutput relationships. Nevertheless, they
are widespread among researchers and practitioners. Methods
based on supervised articial neural networks (Haykin, 1999) and
neuro-fuzzy systems (Fullr, 2000) are among the most popular
ones. An ANN is a network of articial neurons arranged in layers
and connected to each other. The neurons nonlinearly transform
the incoming signals using an activation function and then they
distribute the result to the other neurons. The inputeoutput relationship is encoded in the connection weights; the weights are
adapted to minimize the error between the network outputs and
the targets. In particular, Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNN,
Haykin, 1999) have been popular in the wastewater treatment
sector. Neuro-fuzzy systems combine the features of ANNs with the
human-like reasoning style of fuzzy systems, aiming at complementary techniques and enhanced performance compared with
the individual methodologies. Typically in neuro-fuzzy systems, the
rst layer corresponds to input variables, the middle layers encode
fuzzy IF-THEN rules and the last layer corresponds to the output
variables. The advantages of neuro-fuzzy systems include the
ability of the ANN learning algorithms to learn both fuzzy sets and
fuzzy rules, as well as the potential to use a priori knowledge. In
particular, an Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System
(ANFIS, Jang, 1993) has been popular among soft-sensor designers
in the wastewater treatment sector.
3.3.1.2. Process and sensor monitoring. Such models address the
problem of detecting, identifying and diagnosing normal and
abnormal behaviours in the processes and in the eld instruments,

94

H. Haimi et al. / Environmental Modelling & Software 47 (2013) 88e107

using the easy-to-measure process variables as inputs. The diagnostics comprise the hard-to-measure outputs and, usually, no
prior information about them is available and it must be extracted
from data using dimensionality reduction and clustering approaches. In the less common case where the output information is
available, either as real or categorical values, the inputeoutput
relationship can be modelled as a regression or a classication
problem, respectively. Again, we will mostly focus only on the most
common models for dimensionality reduction and clustering.
In order to detect the occurrence of any variation having an
exceptional or identiable cause, univariate statistical control
charts have been traditionally used to monitor a small number of
process variables. Examining one variable at a time, as though they
were independent, however, makes interpretation and diagnosis
extremely difcult in environments where a large number of variables are continuously varying relative to one another. However,
when the number of variables is large, one often nds that they are
also highly dependent on one another and common methods for
reducing the dimensionality of the problem are the already
mentioned linear approaches based on PCA and PLS.
In the monitoring of the continuous processes and the hardware
sensors, the conventional and adaptive PCA and PLS methods are
popular for reducing the dimensionality of the variables of interest.
The use of PCA methods enables process monitoring in a lowdimensional space dened by the principal components retained
in the model at the price of losing the information encoded in the
less signicant principal components discarded. An established
technique to isolate the variable(s) responsible for the detected
anomalies is to study their contributions to the statistics considered
for the analysis of model residuals. Another traditional monitoring
approach is to use low-dimensional scatter plots dened by the
most signicant principal components, that include most of the
information of the original variables, for observing the transitions
in the process or in the relationships between the supervised
sensors. When using PLS approaches for process monitoring, the
output variables are usually hard, or impossible, to determine in
real-time and they indicate the presence of anomalous situations.
In wastewater treatment, such variables are, for instance, the indicators of the sludge settling properties determined by eld and
laboratory experiments.
In the batch process, an additional dimension to the data
structure is addressed by the batch, the other dimensions representing time and the variables. The Multiway PCA (MPCA) and PLS
(MPLS) are commonly used for dimensionality reduction when
multiway data is considered, for instance in the cases of the batch
processes (Smilde et al., 2004). The multiway extensions rst unfold a three-dimensional data structure into a two-dimensional
structure and, then, PCA or PLS is executed. These methodologies
are often adopted, for instance, for monitoring the batch processes.
Multilevel Component Analysis (MLCA, Timmerman, 2006) is an
extension of PCA, which is useful if the variation in the data occurs
on different levels simultaneously. For monitoring the batch processes, MLCA enables a separated interpretation of the transitions
both within the batches and between the batches in lowdimensional subspaces.
The Kohonen Self-Organizing Map (SOM, Kohonen, 2001) is the
most common unsupervised ANN method and it has also been used
in many wastewater treatment applications. In the model training,
the neurons in the hidden layer adapt themselves to the relationships within a set of input signals and the SOM outputs a lowdimensional (usually two-dimensional) representation of the patters encoded in the training data. In this representation, clusters
corresponding to the characteristic features of the data are formed
onto a topographic map that provides an interpretation of the input
information.

Clustering methods (Everitt et al., 2011) are applied for monitoring using the process variables or new variables, created for
instance by PCA approaches, as the model inputs. In the clustering
analysis, the observations among the training data are grouped in
the clusters based on their similarity. In the conventional clustering
approaches based, for example, on the K-means algorithm, each
observation belongs to one of the clusters. Instead, in the fuzzy
clustering methods, each observation belongs to all the clusters to
some extent, represented by their fuzzy memberships. When
introducing unseen data, their discrete properties can be observed
by monitoring their transition between the clusters dened in the
model training step.
Since most of the basic data-derived techniques cannot deal
with missing data directly, a strategy for their replacement has to
be designed and implemented. A data imputation approach, which
is primitive and not recommended but commonly applied, is to
replace the missing values with the mean values of the affected
variable. Another non-optimal approach is to skip the data samples
consisting of variable or variables with the missing values. Also,
imputing a missing value by a linear interpolation between the
preceding and following existing values is a problematic approach
especially when several sequential values are missing. More efcient approaches based on multivariate statistics of the data
perform the reconstruction of the missing values from other variables of the affected samples (Walczak and Massart, 2001a,b).
When the hardware sensor measurements studied, these approaches are considered as sensor reconstruction and this application area is closely connected with sensor monitoring. More
strategies for dealing with the missing values are reported by Little
and Rubin (2002).
3.3.2. Model training, validation and testing
Most of the model types discussed in this section are characterized by a number of basic parameters and a number of hyper-, or
meta-, parameters that dene their structure and optimize it in
terms of its generalization performances. The basic parameters of
the models are, for instance, the regression coefcients of linear
regression methods, the connection weights of neural and neurofuzzy systems, the loading components in multivariate statistical
methods like PCA and PLS, among the others. The meta-parameters
are, on the other hand, the number of components to be retained in
methods like PCA and PLS, the regularization parameter in linear
shrinkage methods like LARS and LASSO, the number of neurons
and layers in neural and neuro-fuzzy systems, the number of
clusters, among the others. Before a model is able to operate on new
unseen observations, it has to be trained to estimate its basic parameters and it has to be validated to optimize its meta-parameters.
Model validation is a highly important step in soft-sensor development, in which the designer estimates how well the model will
perform on new data.
Ideally, if enough data were available, the soft-sensor developer
would set aside a validation set and use it to assess a model whose
basic parameters are calibrated on a training set, for different values
of its meta-parameters. After nding the optimal set of metaparameters, the developer would then calibrate the model to ultimately set its basic parameters, using all the available learning data
(i.e., both the training and the validation set). The resulting model is
eventually assessed on an independent test set of data. However, it
may be difcult to obtain a sufcient amount of historical data for
the for learning the model according to the aforementioned procedure. In such a situation, the soft-sensor developer has to resort
on error-estimation techniques, like the simple and widely used
cross-validation (Hastie et al., 2009). K-fold cross-validation uses
part of learning data to calibrate the model and a different part to
validate it. The procedure consists of rstly splitting the data in K

H. Haimi et al. / Environmental Modelling & Software 47 (2013) 88e107

roughly equal-size parts, or folds, secondly to set aside the k-th part
and calibrating the model to the other K-1 parts and, thirdly, to
calculate a measure of model accuracy over the k-th part. After
repeating the procedure for all the K parts, then accuracies are
combined to give an average (over the folds) performance of the
model, for a specic set of meta-parameters. The model whose
meta-parameters have the best generalization accuracy is nally
trained using all the learning data and assessed against a test set.
Although cross-validation is the most popular approach to
optimize the generalization performances of data-derived softsensors, alternative techniques based on statistical resampling
methods like bagging (Breiman, 1996) and boosting (Freund and
Schapire, 1997) can be used for the task.

3.4. Model maintenance
4.1. On-line prediction
After the successful design, it is not uncommon to observe a
degradation of the performance of a data-derived soft-sensor. Such
a degradation is often due to changes in process and instrumental
characteristics or operating conditions. In wastewater treatment
applications, the reason for this may be, e.g., variations in inuent
wastewater composition, temperature and ow rate, instruments
recalibrations or operational changes inside the plant. To overcome
such limitations, soft-sensors should be regularly maintained and
updated as the system characteristics change but, their manual and
repeated redesign should be avoided due to the heavy workload.
Most of the soft-sensors currently found in full-scale environments do not provide any automated mechanisms for their
maintenance. To automatically cope with changes in process
characteristics and operating conditions, a number of data-derived
approaches have been however designed and are available for the
developer (Kadlec et al., 2011). The majority of these approaches
are inherently encoded in the adaptive and recursive versions of
multivariate statistical methods like PCA and PLS. An approach
related to the neuro-fuzzy methods also providing adaptation
possibilities is local learning (Atkeson et al., 1997). An adaptive softsensor developed in this framework was published in Kadlec and
Gabrys (2008). In addition, Fujiwara et al. (2009) and Zhu et al.
(2011) discuss the development of maintenance-free soft-sensors
for on-line prediction using local linear regression methods.
4. Soft-sensor applications in WWTPs
Data-derived methods can be used for (i) the on-line prediction
of the primary process variables, (ii) process monitoring and process
fault detection, and (iii) hardware-sensor monitoring and providing
back-up for them, e.g., during the periods of sensor faults, maintenance and calibration. In this section, the reviewed case studies are
organized according to the soft-sensor application categories.
In the beginning of each subsection representing the aforementioned application areas, we review a few representative
studies without separating them based on the modelling methods.
Next, the contributions belonging to the categories are further arranged considering the different families of modelling methods
employed. Among the multivariate methods, case studies applying
conventional methods are introduced rst and, after that, studies
concentrating on advanced techniques such as adaptive, nonlinear
and multiway extensions are presented. As for the ANNs, we rst
introduce publications utilizing FFNNs as the most popular techniques used in WWTPs, then studies using other types of supervised ANNs and, nally, works employing unsupervised ANNs.
Eventually, studies where neuro-fuzzy techniques and hybrid
models are proposed for soft-sensor design are introduced. The
modelling methods applied in the reviewed publications and their
amounts are represented in Fig. 2.

A common application for the data-derived soft-sensors in
wastewater treatment systems involves predicting the primary
process variables. The soft-sensor applications for prediction tasks
in the reviewed publications are summarized in Table 2, where
studies are arranged in the same order as they appear in the text. In
addition, the main features of a few interesting conference publications have been included in the table (marked with an asterisk)
even though they have not been reviewed in this paper.
Some of the most relevant works can be found in continuous
WWTPs. In the earlier soft-sensor applications the SS, BOD and COD
concentrations have been popular predicted outputs, whereas in
more recent publications it has been more common to estimate
nutrient concentrations. This indicates the progress in wastewater
treatment technology, where modern-day municipal WWTPs are
typically designed for nutrient removal and, therefore, reliable information on the nutrient concentrations in the process has
become of interest to the plant operators. The secondary variables
typically used as inputs in the case studies dealing with the
continuous processes include ow rates, pH, temperature and DO,
SS and nutrient concentrations measured in different locations of
the process. As for the batch processes, the typical target has been
to predict the nutrient concentration trends during the aerobic and
anoxic phases using simple on-line measurements, e.g., DO, pH and
Oxidation Reduction Potential (ORP) as the model inputs and,
further, to employ the estimates for controlling the lengths of the
phases. In both continuous and batch problems, the most
commonly used modelling method for the reconstruction of the
desired outputs has been ANNs, especially FFNNs, followed by
multivariate statistical methods based on PLS.
A FFNN was applied for the estimation of NH4eN and NO3eN
concentrations in a municipal ASP by Bongards (2001). Moreover,
the predicted nutrient concentrations were successfully used as
inputs for a fuzzy controller dosing high-strength sludge treatment
reject water from a buffer tank into the wastewater treatment line.
The proposed solution improved the treatment performance and
helped in prevention of the high nitrogen concentration peaks in
the efuent. Flow rate, conductivity, DO and nutrient measurements were used as inputs to predict future nutrient concentrations. Lee et al. (2008) developed soft-sensors for the prediction of
COD, NH4eN and PO4eP concentrations in the efuent of smallscale municipal ASPs by using FFNN techniques. Simple on-line
measurements such as turbidity, ORP, temperature, conductivity,
pH and DO were used as inputs to a FFNN. The authors found that a
signicant increase in estimation accuracy could be, however,
achieved by integrating the FFNN with an Auto-Regressive Exogenous (ARX) model providing time-lags. The results demonstrated
the improved capability of the integrated methodology in capturing
the nonlinearities and dynamics of the processes. The estimates

were considered sufcient alternatives for the expensive instruments for measuring nutrient concentrations. Woo et al. (2009)
applied different PLS approaches for the real-time prediction of
three outputs, the efuent COD, Total Nitrogen (TN) and total cyanides concentrations, in an ASP treating cokes wastewater. The
authors used 27 variables measured in inuent, anoxic tank,

aerobic tank, secondary clarier and efuent as model inputs, some
of them being time-lagged. While the conventional PLS model was
not capable of modelling the process satisfactorily, a Neural
Network PLS (NNPLS, Qin and McAvoy, 1992) achieved improved
estimation accuracies. The best prediction performance was,
however, obtained by a KPLS model. Interestingly, the models were

H. Haimi et al. / Environmental Modelling & Software 47 (2013) 88e107

further compared in terms of their complexity; for the task, the
authors used the Bayesian Information Criterion which conrmed
the ability of KPLS to outperform both linear and nonlinear PLS
when considering both accuracy and complexity.
As for the batch processes, a study by Aguado et al. (2006)
compared the performances of several approaches based on PCR,
PLS and FFNNs for predicting the PO4eP concentration prole in a
pilot-scale SBR treating synthetic sewage and targeting for the
EBPR. The authors found the batch-wise unfolding MPLS models to
outperform the other techniques used for the estimation task.
Moreover, the proposed MPLS model used only on-line measurements of pH, conductivity, ORP, DO and temperature as inputs,
whereas some of the other models also used time-lagged inputs.
4.1.1. Multivariate statistical models
Multivariate statistics, in particular those based on PLS, are one
of the typical techniques used as soft-sensors for prediction tasks.
In an early application in a municipal ASP, conventional PLS was
used for estimating Total Phosphorus (TP) and COD concentrations
and turbidity in the efuent (Aarnio and Minkkinen, 1986). The
authors found the methodology to be feasible for recognizing the
reasons for sludge bulking episodes which were responsible for
poor efuent quality. Blom (1996) designed a PLS model for estimating inuent TP concentrations in a municipal WWTP. He
considered the prediction accuracy of a model based on daily laboratory analyses quite acceptable. Adaptive extensions of multivariate methods have also been proposed for prediction purposes.
In a study by Teppola et al. (1999b), MLR, PCR and PLS models
combined with a Kalman lter providing time-lags were presented
for the estimation of the Diluted Sludge Volume Index (DSVI) and
COD reduction in an ASP of a paper mill. The static models were not
successful in approximating the output variables, whereas the use
of the Kalman lter remarkably improved the predictions of the
DSVI. In the case of COD estimation, there were no notable improvements obtained by using the Kalman lter. Lee et al. (2007)
proposed Robust Adaptive PLS (RAPLS) for prediction of the Total
Oxygen Demand (TOD) in the efuent and the production rate of
methane gas in an AF process treating industrial wastewater. The
authors indicated that the estimates could be also used for
detecting abnormal process operations.
Yoo et al. (2004) applied conventional PLS, Quadratic PLS (QPLS,
Baf et al., 1999) and Fuzzy PLS (FPLS, Bang et al., 2003) models for
two soft-sensor case studies. In the case where the IWA/COST
Benchmark Simulation Model BSM1 (Copp, 2002) was used as a test
platform and efuent NH4eN and NO3eN concentrations were
considered as the output variables, it was indicated that FPLS had
the best prediction performance. In a full-scale industrial ASP
application, the researchers used the Sludge Volume Index (SVI)
and the reductions of cyanide and COD in the process as the estimated outputs. Here, PLS and QPLS models showed a slightly better
prediction performance than FPLS models. However, the prediction
accuracy of SVI was poor using any of the methods. Drrenmatt and
Gujer (2012) compared different data-driven modelling approaches
for approximating COD concentration in the primary clarier
efuent and NH4eN concentration in the bioreactor of a municipal
ASP. The authors found Generalized Least Squares Regression
(GLSR, Kariya and Kurata, 2004) estimates to be less accurate than
the ANN estimates, but on the other hand, they considered the
transparency of the GLSR models to be a signicant advantage
compared with the opaqueness of the ANNs. Therefore, they
considered the interpretability to justify the selection of the GLSR
approach for the soft-sensor development. In a recent publication,
Corona et al. (2013) designed an array of soft-sensors for estimating
the NO3eN concentrations in the denitrifying post-ltration unit in
a municipal WWTP. The authors found only minor improvements

97

in prediction accuracies when linear MLR and PLS models were
replaced by nonlinear Local Linear Regression based on k-Nearest
Neighbours (k-NN LLR, Stone, 1977), at the price of slightly heavier
computational cost. The estimation accuracies of the models were
reported being comparable with the resolution of the hardware
sensors.
4.1.2. Articial neural network models
As already pointed out, ANN techniques have been popular in
soft-sensor for prediction of process variables in the biological
WWTPs.
Most commonly the applications in this research area have
considered the use of FFNNs in full-scale ASPs. In an early study,
Capodaglio et al. (1991) developed a FFNN for estimating SVI in a
municipal ASP targeting at monitoring bulking sludge episodes.
Tyagi and Du (1992) proposed to use a FFNN for the prediction of
the inhibitory effect of heavy metals on activated sludge. The authors used the ratios of the maximum specic growth-rate in the
presence and absence of heavy metals as model outputs to be
estimated. In their conclusion, the authors found the estimates to
be close to the experimental results. At about the same time, Boger
(1992) suggested a soft-sensor based on a FFNN for predicting the
average weekly concentration of efuent NH4eN in a municipal
ASP and diagnosed the process variables associated with the high
NH4eN concentrations. A study on a FFNN-based soft-sensor for
estimating the efuent BOD and SS concentrations in a trickling
lter for municipal wastewater treatment was published by Pu and
Hung (1995). However, the prediction errors indicated that the
performance of the models was not adequate, because of the long
interval between the measurements available for training the
model. Hck and Khne (1996) used FFNN models for estimating
COD and NH4eN concentrations in the inuent wastewater and
NH4eN and NO3eN concentrations in the aeration basin of a
municipal ASP. They found the ANN estimates reliable but only for a
limited period of time, yet still considerably better when compared
with the least square estimates.
More recently, Hamed et al. (2004) presented a FFNN for the
estimation of BOD and SS concentrations in the efuent of a
municipal ASP in a study where they used the daily records of BOD
and SS concentrations in several process stages as model inputs.
They found the prediction accuracy fairly low, especially for the SS
concentration, apparently due to the insufcient amount and
quality of the available process data. In their study, Bisschops et al.
(2006) investigated the use of a FFNN for predicting the end-point
of exogenous respiration, which indicates complete oxidation of
biodegradable matter, in an activated sludge system. Interestingly,
they used recorded industrial wastewater respirograms and articial respirograms simulated based on the ASM1 model (Henze et al.,
2000) for training and testing the models. The amount of the
available data was too limited for considering a practical implementation of the model. The researchers speculated that repeating
the study with a larger number of respirograms would highlight the
true potential of FFNNs for determining the treatability of wastewater in real-time.
Grey modelling and FFNN techniques were applied for the
prediction of SS and COD concentrations in the efuent of a
continuous sequencing batch ASP treating hospital wastewater (Pai
et al., 2007) and, of a conventional industrial ASP (Pai et al., 2008)
where also efuent pH was estimated. In these studies, the authors
found the grey models more promising for the prediction tasks
compared with the FFNN models, especially when the operation
data available was not extensive. In their research, Poutiainen et al.
(2010) employed FFNN for estimating the next days efuent Total
Suspended Solids (TSS) load in a municipal ASP. However, the
prediction accuracy suffered from an inadequate amount of

98

H. Haimi et al. / Environmental Modelling & Software 47 (2013) 88e107

available process data, which did not contain all the seasonal patters. In addition, the efuent concentrations of nutrients, organic
matter or SS in full-scale ASPs have been predicted using FFNN
methods in publications by Fu and Poch (1995), Hamoda et al.
(1999), Hanbay et al. (2007), Machn et al. (2007), Mjalli et al.
(2007) and Moral et al. (2008).
Case studies targeting at prediction of the variables using FFNNs
in laboratory and pilot-scale processes have also been presented.
The efuent concentrations of a pilot-scale MBR treating industrial
wastewater were predicted by using a cascade-forward ANN model
by inar et al. (2006). The authors reported the prediction accuracy
of the model to be successful for NH4eN and NO3eN concentrations, whereas the results for COD and TP prediction were considered only satisfactory. The reasons for achieving only satisfactory
accuracies obviously include the scarcity of the data used in the
work: only 20 daily observations for model training and 10 observations for testing. In a publication by Aguado et al. (2009), FFNN
models were employed for the prediction of the PO4eP concentration trends in a laboratory-scale SBR aiming at EBPR. Particularly,
they showed the real-time prediction to enable the optimization of
the lengths of the phases in the SBR instead of the xed time
schedule basis typically applied for the purpose. Delnavaz et al.
(2010) designed a FFNN-based soft-sensor for predicting the COD
reduction and efuent aniline concentration of a pilot-scale MBBR
fed with synthetic wastewater of various strengths and operated
with different retention times. They found the estimation results to
be satisfactory and ANN models to provide robust tools since the
prediction errors in the experiments varied only slightly.
Soft-sensors aiming at on-line prediction have been investigated by employing FFNNs in simulated treatment processes. In
an interesting study by Rduly et al. (2007), the prediction performance and simulation time of a FFNN model were compared with a
phenomenological WWTP model (ASM3, Henze et al., 2000) where
the preliminary inuent data of the BSM2 platform (Jeppsson et al.,
2006) extended with a disturbance scenario generator was applied
as the inuent module. The results showed that the FFNN model
was capable of providing good prediction accuracies for efuent
NH4eN, BOD and SS concentrations, whereas the estimations of
COD and TN concentrations were less satisfactory. The authors also
found that FFNN models allow for a considerably faster WWTP
performance evaluation compared with the ASM3 model, including
the time needed for training the models. Caraman et al. (2007)
proposed a FFNN model for the estimation of variables and to be
used as internal model for a predictive controller in a simulated
ASP. The tests with a simplied ASP model indicated that the predicted substrate and DO concentrations in the ASP were accurate,
but there was a noticeable shift between the estimated and
measured biomass concentrations in the bioreactor. In addition,
Clara (2008) presented FFNN-based models for approximating the
efuent TN and Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN) concentrations using
the BSM1 as the test platform. Interestingly, he applied successfully
general algorithms and fuzzy systems for variable selection and
found FFNN a condent tool especially for estimating the TN
behaviour.
Apart from FFNNs, also other types of supervised ANNs have
been used for estimation purposes. In a study by Belanche et al.
(1999), the efuent BOD and COD concentrations of a municipal
ASP were estimated and the fuzzy heterogeneous Time Delay
Neural Network (TDNN, de Vries and Principe, 1991) was shown to
outperform the classical TDNN in the investigation. In another
application in the same WWTP, Belanche et al. (2000) reported that
a hybrid TDNN model provided the best prediction performance for
the efuent SS concentration out of the three ANN approaches and
the k-NN algorithm tested. The proposed methodology was also
able to handle missing values in data. Dellana and West (2009)

investigated the performances of the TDNN and linear ARIMA
models for predicting the wastewater efuent BOD, SS, TN and TP
concentrations in a work where they used both articial and realworld WWTP data sets. The authors concluded that the TDNN
models were more accurate in the cases concerning all the realworld process data, but in half of the articial data cases, the
ARIMA models were found more precise. This outcome highlights
the need for a careful consideration in the model structure selection
taking into account the nature of the data. In another study,
Luccarini et al. (2002) proposed soft-sensors for the estimation of
the NH4eN, NO3eN and PO4eP concentration trends in a
laboratory-scale SBR treating synthetic wastewater by using the
Elman NN methodology (Elman, 1990). They reported that the softsensors had the potential to be used for controlling the lengths of
the anoxic and aerobic phases in SBRs. Borowa et al. (2007) presented a soft-sensor for the prediction of the efuent ow rate,
NO3eN and NH4eN concentrations and DO concentration in the
aerobic zone of a modelled ASP using State - Space Wavelet Neural
Networks (SSWN, Zamarrenoa and Vega, 1998) and they demonstrated that the method was able to approximate the variables.
Recently, Qiao et al. (2011) proposed Repair Radial Basis Function
Neural Network (RRBF) for estimating the efuent COD concentrations in municipal WWTPs, resulting in acceptable accuracy.
As for the unsupervised ANN methods, Grieu et al. (2006)
proposed the on-line prediction of inuent and efuent COD,
NH4eN and SS concentrations by means of SOM and FFNN for a
municipal WWTP. In particular, SOM was used satisfactorily for
recognizing correlations between the process variables and for
choosing the input variables for the FFNN models. However, the
prediction accuracies were considered only satisfactory. This is
possibly due to the nature of the acquired data consisting of daily
average measurements for a four-year period. Rustum and Adeloye
(2007) proposed SOM estimates for replacing outliers and missing
values in the process data of a municipal ASP. The results indicated
that the performance of the SOM approach was superior for the
considered task compared with FFNN and MLR models. The SOM
model also did particularly well in predicting the Sludge Age and
Food to Microorganism Ratio (F/M). Moreover, Rustum et al. (2008)
used the SOM technique successfully in a soft-sensor for approximating the inuent BOD concentration of three municipal WWTPs.
4.1.3. Neuro-fuzzy systems
Neuro-fuzzy systems, especially ANFIS models, have been
applied for prediction tasks in various wastewater treatment processes. In a detailed study by Tay and Zhang (1999), ANFIS models
were used for estimation in a laboratory-scale UASB reactor and a
full-scale AFBR. In the case of the UASB reactor, the neuro-fuzzy
technique was successfully applied for predicting the volumetric
methane production and the efuent Total Organic Carbon (TOC)
concentration. In the AFBR application, a model with six output
variables provided satisfactory estimates given the limited amount
of available process data. Tay and Zhang (2000) used the ANFIS
methodology successfully also for prediction of the volumetric
methane production, the efuent TOC concentration and the total
VFA concentration in three laboratory-scale wastewater treatment
processes subjected to shock tests. In the work by Civelekoglu et al.
(2007), ANFIS models were used for estimating the efuent COD,
NH4eN and TN concentrations of an ASP treating the wastewater of
a sugar factory. They demonstrated that the estimates t well with
the measured values. In addition, PCA was applied as a data preprocessing method which actually decreased signicantly the
prediction errors. Fernandez et al. (2009) developed a neuro-fuzzy
system to predict the daily inuent ow rates in two municipal
ASPs, and the model validation showed a strong agreement between the estimates and the measured data. In their case study,

H. Haimi et al. / Environmental Modelling & Software 47 (2013) 88e107

Huang et al. (2010) suggested an approach utilizing the ANFIS
technique for the estimation of NH4eN, NO3eN and PO4eP concentrations in a laboratory-scale SBR. The data were rst analysed
with the MPCA methodology in order to select adequate training
data sets and both normal and abnormal testing data sets. The
model testing with normal data indicated that the predicted values
were able to follow the measured values well, whereas the use of
abnormal data resulted in poor prediction ability, which was expected since the training data only spanned the normal operating
range. Wan et al. (2011) presented a soft-sensor application where
they used an ANFIS model for estimating the efuent COD and SS
concentrations in an aerated SBFR treating paper industry wastewater. The authors also applied PCA successfully for the selection of
the input variables for the ANFIS models. The ANFIS methodology
has also been recently used in a proposal for the soft-sensors in
industrial wastewater treatment by Pai et al. (2011).
4.1.4. Hybrid models
Hybrid models combining different modelling approaches on
the system level provide interesting alternatives for soft-sensor
design. In an early study, Ct et al. (1995) used hybrid models
consisting of a modied ASM1 model and FFNN models for predicting the concentrations of DO in the bioreactor, of SS, COD and
NH4eN in the efuent and of SS in the return sludge with good
accuracy in a municipal ASP. A study by Cohen et al. (1997) applied
a combination of FFNN and fuzzy methods to modelling process
variables in a SBR treating municipal, dairy and beef processing
wastewaters. The models did not provide accurate predictions, but
nevertheless they were found to be useful for indicating the
general process trends. In their research, Choi and Park (2001)
proposed a hybrid system combining PCA and FFNN techniques
for estimating the inuent TKN concentration of an industrial ASP.
Particularly, they found that the hybrid technique reduced the
overtting problems of the FFNN models. Lee et al. (2002) estimated MLSS, SS, COD and cyanide concentrations in a full-scale
ASP treating cokes wastewater using several modelling techniques. In their conclusion, the authors suggested that a parallel
hybrid technique combining phenomenological and FFNN models
provided the best prediction performance. In another work aiming
at approximating the process parameters of an ASP for cokes
wastewater treatment, Lee et al. (2005) combined phenomenological model based on ASM1 and process knowledge with a
number of PLS and ANN methods. As a result, they indicated a
hybrid NNPLS model to achieve the best prediction performance,
also providing an ability to detect and isolate process faults. In a
soft-sensor proposal by Hong et al. (2007), the real-time estimation of NH4eN, NO3eN and PO4eP concentrations in a laboratoryscale SBR was implemented by a combination of MPCA and FFNN
with ARX structuring. The model with simple on-line measurements as the input data showed an excellent prediction capability
with normal validation sets, whereas the prediction ability was
not satisfactory with abnormal data sets employed. Kim et al.
(2009) integrated MPCA and FFNN methodologies for soft-sensor
modelling of the efuent COD, TN and TP concentrations in a
municipal ASP. Specically, they utilized MPCA for extracting information from the one-day process data batches to be used for
the input variable selection for the FFNN model. The testing results
showed that the predictions were not accurate, but they could
follow the trends of the measured data. Presumably, more
frequent data sets would have helped in catching the daily variations in the process and, thus, in increasing the estimation
performance. In their work, Rustum (2009) investigated a combination of SOM and ANFIS methods for estimating efuent BOD
and SS concentrations in a municipal ASP. The SOM model was
shown to be able to extract features from noisy data and eliminate

99

the effect of the missing values that the ANFIS model was not
capable of dealing with.
4.2. Process monitoring and process fault detection
Various methodologies have been employed in the publications
concentrating on the process monitoring and process fault detection in WWTPs. The reviewed studies targeting for monitoring the
treatment processes are summarized in Table 3, where the
modelling methods, plant types and treatment processes are presented. Also, the main features of a few conference publications
have been included in the table (marked with an asterisk), but
those have not been reviewed in this paper.
Many of the early soft-sensor applications in wastewater treatment considered monitoring bulking sludge episodes, which
diminish the efuent wastewater quality and disturb the operation
of the ASP. For instance monitoring SVI or its variants, that describe
sludge settling properties and indicate presence of the bulking
sludge, have been the goal of several studies. Taking into account
the fact that the bulking sludge episodes do not usually appear
rapidly, it is reasonable that their detection was among the rst

process fault monitoring interests, as the data-derived models were
substantially dependent on the laboratory measurements. Together
with the increase of the real-time measurements in WWTPs, the
proposals for process monitoring have focused on a wider range of
anomalies, which appear more abruptly. In addition, the monitoring of the states in SBRs has been a popular research objective,
particularly, aiming at optimized control on the lengths of the
phases. The usual secondary variables used for monitoring tasks are
ow rates, pH, temperature and DO, SS and nutrient concentrations
measured in different locations of the process. Most typically,
multivariate methods and the SOM combined with clustering algorithms have been applied for process monitoring purposes.
The actual pioneering work on the applications of multivariate
methods in soft-sensor design in the wastewater treatment sector
has been done for monitoring ASPs in the pulp and paper industry
by Mujunen (1999) and Teppola (1999) and for monitoring and
control in municipal ASPs by Rosen (2001). The multivariate
methods have been employed for soft-sensor development in
these works and especially Rosen (2001) developed advanced
techniques that were shown to be more adequate than the conventional techniques for the eld of operation. For instance, Rosen
and Lennox (2001) tested Adaptive PCA (APCA) and Multiscale
PCA (MSPCA) for monitoring a municipal ASP. As model inputs, the
authors used 14 variables including ow rate, pH, ammonia,
temperature and air-valve positions at several points in the plant.
The researchers concluded that both techniques had potential to
overcome the difculties associated with the changing process
conditions. The MSPCA method separating the data in different
time scales is more complex than APCA, but it was shown to
provide more information about the process disturbances. As an
example of a practical implementation, Lee et al. (2008) applied
APCA based on the moving window technique for the real-time
remote monitoring of small-scale municipal ASPs. They noticed
that the APCA models overcame the problem of evolving dynamics
and reduced the number of false alarms signicantly. The models
were used to detect abnormal process behaviour and to provide
the plant operators with an early warning when such situations
were identied.
4.2.1. Multivariate statistical models
Among multivariate statistics, the conventional PCA technique
has been used for process state identication especially in earlier
applications. Rosen and Olsson (1998) applied the PCA score plots
for monitoring operational states in a full-scale municipal ASP. First,
they built a PCA model using ve input variables and samples
corresponding to normal operating conditions. After that, deviations from the normal process behaviour were monitored using
a two-dimensional score plot. Teppola et al. (1999a) combined PCA
and FCM clustering algorithms for monitoring and visualizing
process states and seasonal uctuations in an ASP treating wastewater from a paper mill. The researchers were able, for instance, to
detect and isolate an excess addition of phosphorus compounds
with the proposed methodology. In their investigation, Tomita et al.
(2002) proposed the PCA method for the analysis and disturbance
detection in a modelled ASP based on the ASM1 protocol and they
found three groups of process variables that characterized the
system behaviour. Olsson et al. (2003) used PCA for monitoring the
operational states in a municipal ASP as one example of using information technology for decision support purposes. Specically,
four process states were identied based on the training data and a
score plot was applied for monitoring the shifting of the new data
between the clusters representing the different operational states.
A study by Miettinen et al. (2004), applied PCA and Parallel Factor
Analysis (PARAFAC, Bro, 1997) for monitoring a multistage biological LTP for municipal wastewater. Their results established that the

operational states and the ponds, where particular reactions
occurred, could be identied using both of the methods. Moon et al.
(2009) presented a methodology for the identication of the process states in a municipal ASP by means of PCA and K-means
clustering. They identied ve operational groups and showed that
the operational map could provide visual information on the dynamic trends of the process states.
The conventional PLS combined with an auto-correlation function was used for modelling DSVI and the COD, nitrogen and
phosphorus reductions in the ASP for the treatment of paper mill
wastewater in order to detect the various process shifts by Teppola
et al. (1997). Although the model was able to estimate DVSI well, it
did not provide good estimates for the reductions, which was due
to data obtained from single daily samples or daily averages of the
continuous measurements. Nevertheless, the authors concluded
that almost in every case, the disturbance was successfully isolated
and the reasons for it were effectively analysed. In another softsensor application, Teppola et al. (1998) combined a PLS with a
FCM clustering aiming at novel monitoring tools for an ASP of a
paper mill. They applied the methodology successfully for monitoring DSVI and, for instance, recognized seasonal variations in the
process. A study by Mujunen et al. (1998) employed PLS for
monitoring SVI and DVSI, and the COD, TN and TP concentrations
and their reductions in three ASPs treating wastewater from the
pulp and paper industry. The authors concluded that a higher
sampling frequency or new input variables would have been
needed for modelling the peak values successfully. Rosen and
Olsson (1998) demonstrated the use of PLS for monitoring the
operational states of a municipal WWTP when considering the
efuent turbidity as the model output. In their work, the process
variables associated to the disturbances were isolated by using
contribution plots. Teppola and Minkkinen (1999) employed combinations of PLS and clustering methods for monitoring the ASP of a
paper mill. Particularly, they used the latent variables of PLS analysis as inputs for the FCM and Possibilistic C-means (PCM,
Krishnapuram and Keller, 1993) clustering algorithms.
Adaptive extensions of multivariate techniques have been proposed for WWTP monitoring in a number of publications. The work
of Rosen and Yuan (2001) concentrated on APCA and FCM clustering methods combined for monitoring and control set-point
denition purposes in a case study where a simulated step-feed
ASP was used. In particular, they used the inuent data of a preliminary version of BSM1 modied with an extreme NH4eN load
disturbance for the simulation. Supervisory control strategies were
then successfully used under normal conditions, storm with sewer
ush-out, storm, rain and extreme NH4eN load. Later, Rosen et al.
(2002) utilized the same process state estimation approach in a
proposal for a predictive supervisory controller during extreme
events using a modied BSM1 as test bench. Adaptive Multiscale
PCA (AdMSPCA) extension was successfully applied for monitoring
a municipal ASP by Lennox and Rosen (2002). When compared
with the APCA, the authors observed AdMSPCA to have the ability
to adapt to a much broader range of changes. A publication by
Rosen et al. (2003) focused on the challenges of multivariate
monitoring in municipal wastewater treatment. The authors did
not nd the PCA suitable for the monitoring task, but an adaptive
scaling of the its parameters improved the results considerably. A
study by Yoo et al. (2003) proposed Fuzzy PCR (FPCR) as an adaptive
monitoring tool for an industrial ASP. The methodology was
demonstrated to be able to distinguish between a large process
change and a simple fault or a short disturbance. A study by Aguado
and Rosen (2008) investigated successfully APCA and FCM for the
efcient monitoring of the operational states and for tracing the
most likely causes of the disturbances in municipal ASPs. The
inuent data of the BSM1_LT platform (Rosen et al., 2004),

H. Haimi et al. / Environmental Modelling & Software 47 (2013) 88e107

including a realistic set of process disturbances and failures, was
used in the research.
Multiway methods have been popular in particular in the SBR
case studies. Aguado et al. (2007b) used a MPLS to correlate several
on-line variables with phosphorus removal efciency in a
laboratory-scale SBR aiming at EBPR. They identied conductivity
as a suitable variable for detecting the process upsets associated
with a negative effect on the phosphorus removal efciency. A
study by Aguado et al. (2007a) proposed MPCA models for fault
monitoring in a laboratory-scale SBR operated for an EBPR purpose.
The authors found the methodology to be straightforward and very
consistent in the diagnosis of the detected process abnormalities.
Villez et al. (2008) applied a combination of MPCA and Learning
Algorithm for Multivariable Data Analysis (LAMDA, Aguilar-Martin
and Lpez de Mntaras, 1982) clustering techniques for an analysis
of a pilot-scale SBR treating synthetic sewage. They showed the
combined methodology to provide an efcient and robust tool for
screening and interpreting the data from a batch process.
Another approach presented by Villez et al. (2010) employed the
Hotellings T2 statistic for detection of the operational states in a
pilot-scale SBR aiming at EBPR. They used the information obtained
from the model with ve input variables for the control of the
process which reduced the length of the aerated phase by 41%. The
authors also conclude that the proposed methodology is general in
nature and, thus, not limited only for the reported application.
4.2.2. Articial neural network models
As for the ANN methods, Fuente and Vega (1999) used the frequency content of the fault-indicating signals and a FFNN for process fault detection in a municipal ASP. In particular, faults in
aeration turbines were monitored and the results demonstrated
the reliability of the proposed method. West and Mangiameli
(2000) compared the performances of different statistical models
and ANN architectures for monitoring a municipal ASP. As a result,
they found Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN, Haykin, 1999) to
be the most competent method for detecting normal and abnormal
process conditions. In their investigation, Baruch et al. (2005) used
a nonlinear Recurrent Trainable Neural Network (RTNN, Baruch
et al., 2001) for real-time state estimation and prediction of the
biomass concentration in the recycle sludge ow of a simulated
ASP. A RTNN was also employed for systems identication and state
estimation for a simulated ASP by Baruch and Mariaca-Gaspar
(2009). A work of Brault et al. (2010) presented a FFNN-based
soft-sensor for monitoring the settling trends of the sludge, in
particular the Stirred Sludge Volume Index (SSVI), in an ASP
treating wastewater from a pulp and paper industry. The input
variables included non-conventional parameters, such as an
adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration, which was found to
improve the model performance by providing with an early signal
for sludge bulking.
The operating conditions and relationships between the process
variables were monitored in a municipal ASP with the SOM by
Hong et al. (2003). They identied ve operational clusters and
extracted information on the reasons for a poor performance from
the properties of the clusters. inar (2005) used the SOM for analysing the causes for the high efuent concentrations in a municipal
ASP. He established that low pH values were responsible for the
high efuent BOD and SS concentrations, and a high solids retention time for an increased efuent fecal coliform concentration. A
study by Gonzlez and Lpez Garca (2006) proposed a combination of the SOM and K-means clustering algorithms for monitoring
operational states, especially the end-point of the aerobic phase, in
a SBR treating coke wastewater. Also Heikkinen et al. (2011) applied
the same combination of methods to detect the process states in an
industrial ASP. As a result, they identied four operational clusters

101

corresponding to summertime, abnormal situations such as stoppages, wintertime, and unstable operational states such as bulking
and foaming.
4.2.3. Fuzzy systems
Fuzzy methods have also been proposed for process monitoring
in wastewater treatment. Marsili-Libelli and Mller (1996) used
FCM for monitoring operational states in a pilot-scale AD process
that was used in parallel with the main anaerobic digestion stage
located before the aerobic bioreactors in a municipal WWTP. The
methodology was successful in recognizing the process shifting
between operational states such as normal, toxic, overload and
inhibition situations. The authors used biogas production and
hydrogen concentration in off-gas as input variables and the data
were selected from a collection of shock experiments. In another
paper, Marsili-Libelli (2006) presented a pattern recognition system in a laboratory-scale SBR based on fuzzy clustering of the derivatives of three process signals that were denoised by using
Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT, Strang, 1994). In particular, he
employed Gustafsson-Kessel fuzzy clustering algorithm (GK,
Gustafson and Kessel, 1979) and the information provided by the
procedure was used for the control of the durations of the phases in
the process.
4.3. Sensor monitoring
Another task for soft-sensors in WWTPs is the validation, fault
detection and diagnosis of the hardware instrumentation. The
sensor monitoring applications in the reviewed publications and a
few conference publications that are not reviewed in this paper
(marked with an asterisk) are summarized in Table 4, where the
modelling methods, plant types and treatment processes used in
the case studies are collected.
Typically, advanced multivariate approaches have been applied
to the identication of reasons for sensor faults, such as bias, drift,
complete failure and precision degradation. Most commonly,
monitoring of the NH4eN and NO3eN sensors in ASPs have been
studied in the reviewed publications. The scarcity of the reviewed
papers in this application area and the fact that all of them are
relatively recent suggests that sensor monitoring in wastewater
treatment facilities is still an emerging research eld. In addition,
data from a full-scale WWTP was used only in one of the publications whereas the majority of them considered simulated
processes.
Lee et al. (2004) proposed a PCA-based sensor fault detection
and isolation application using BSM1 as a test environment. They
used a time-lagged APCA model to identify faults in seven sensors
and tested two case studies: the precision degradation of an
inuent NH4eN sensor and the bias in an inuent ow rate sensor.

In both of the cases, the APCA model detected and isolated faulty
sensors clearly and consistently. An investigation by Lee et al.
(2006) presented a Sensor Quality Index in a publication where
APCA was applied for the detection of sensor faults in the BSM1
platform. Moreover, the studied fault scenarios included an inuent
NH4eN sensor corrupted by a drifting fault, an inuent ow rate
sensor corrupted by a bias fault and a NO3eN sensor in the ASP
corrupted by a precision degradation fault. The authors indicated
the proposed approach to perform well for sensor fault detection
and to identify the faulty sensors efciently in the dynamic process.
However, a limitation of the presented APCA technique concerned
its inability to identify the faulty sensors that cause process transitions, i.e. the situations when a faulty instrument is connected to a
control loop. Yoo et al. (2008) investigated a PCA technique combined with fault indices for sensor fault identication and reconstruction. In particular, they successfully tested two realistic fault
scenarios related to a DO sensor in a case study dealing with a
laboratory-scale SHARON process used for the treatment of
wastewater containing high concentrations of nitrogen. In a work
by Baggiani and Marsili-Libelli (2009), APCA with differing moving
window lengths were proposed for real-time fault detection and
isolation in NH4eN and NO3eN sensors in an ASP treating municipal sewage and septic tank discharges. The faults were classied
into three categories: sensor faults, spikes and process anomalies.
The short-window model was capable of detecting all the faults,
while the detection percentage of the long-window model
decreased to 84%. In addition, the sensors responsible for the faults
were isolated by using the conventional contribution plots. Lee
et al. (2009) proposed a Multi-Scale PLS (MSPLS) algorithm
combining PLS and wavelets for sensor fault detection in a biological AF process treating wastewater from a petrochemical industry. They found the fault detection ability of the MSPLS
approach to be good and the methodology to properly diagnose the
detected sensor faults and to provide scale-level information about
the fault characteristics.
In an ANN-based application, Caccavale et al. (2010) employed a
FFNN for the detection and diagnosis of NH4eN and NO3eN sensor
faults in a simulated alternated aeration ASP. They showed that the
faulty sensors were correctly isolated and information on the typology of the fault could be obtained by analysing the shape of the
corresponding residuals between the predicted outputs and sensor
measurements.
5. Discussion
5.1. Applications in the wastewater treatment facilities
Recently, the majority of the soft-sensor applications in wastewater treatment have been associated with prediction tasks. This
can be observed in Fig. 3, where the shares of the on-line prediction, process monitoring and sensor monitoring applications in the
reviewed publications have been divided into the studies published
in 2005 or earlier and the studies published after 2005. The need for
reliable on-line predictions indicates the importance of efcient
process monitoring and control in WWTPs under strict treatment
regulations. The variables describing the content of organic matter
that are challenging to measure in real-time have been the most
common choices for the predicted model outputs in the reviewed
publications. Also, in an extensive number of soft-sensor applications, nitrogen compounds have been selected for the estimated
output variables. This is the case especially in more recent studies,
which shows the trend that present-day municipal treatment
processes are being designed, in particular, for nutrient removal. In
addition, data-derived models for sensor fault monitoring have
been proposed in recent publications. However, the rather small

Fig. 3. The soft-sensor applications in the reviewed publications.

number of existing publications suggests that the research area is
relatively new in wastewater treatment.
As for the process types in the case studies shown in Fig. 4a,
municipal and industrial WWTPs corresponded for 38% and 25%,
respectively. In addition, pilot- and laboratory-scale processes were
used in 18% of investigations, most of them being SBRs. The share of
the simulated processes in the reviewed papers papers was 19%,
where the BSM platforms were the most popular virtual test environments. According to the data descriptions in the studies, it
appears that in the municipal WWTPs, a larger amount of process
variables measured on-line are available for modelling purposes
compared with the industrial WWTPs. Even though biological
treatment processes are common in both municipal and industrial
plants, it is obvious that the differences in the composition of
inuent wastewater, especially regarding the nutrient concentrations, give rise to more complex treatment processes and, hence,
more versatile monitoring and control requirements in the
municipal facilities. In spite of that, interesting data-derived softsensor applications have been proposed also for industrial wastewater treatment for a wide range of tasks.
The useful soft-sensor applications ease with the operation of
the treatment processes, for instance, by providing benecial
monitoring tools and helping in reducing the operational costs or
reaching the treatment requirements. The desired monitoring tools
often depend on the type of the process. For example, considering
SBRs, they typically relate to the recognition of the optimal lengths
of the phases, while in ASPs they may concern the detection of
abnormal process states. As for the cost reduction, the on-line
variable estimates used for supporting the process control may
give advantages, e.g., in avoiding excessive aeration or chemical
dosing. In the modern-day plants, soft-sensors for such purposes
typically aim at the prediction of nutrient concentrations in various
locations of the treatment line, or at monitoring the hardware instruments measuring the nutrient contents. On the other hand, the

design (b) in the reviewed publications.

H. Haimi et al. / Environmental Modelling & Software 47 (2013) 88e107

treatment requirements vary depending, e.g., on the local legislation, the size of the plant and the characteristics of the wastewater,
which affect case-specically the types of useful soft-sensors. For
instance, the shifting of the typical treatment requirements from
organic matter to nutrients in the municipal sector during the
recent decades has also made soft-sensor estimates of nutrient
concentrations more preferable. In the industrial sector, the
removal of compounds specic to the eld of industry is regulated
by the authorities. Therefore, the estimates of such specic compounds has been of special interest in the soft-sensor design and
shown to be useful for the plant operation. The appropriate
modelling methodologies for soft-sensor design are typically casespecic and they depend on the problem and process considered as
well as the available process data.
5.2. Modelling approaches used for the soft-sensor design
Different multivariate and ANN methodologies have typically
been used for the data-driven soft-sensor development in wastewater treatment, with the supervised ANN techniques having been
the most popular. The shares of the data-derived methods applied
for soft-sensor design in the reviewed publications are presented in
Fig. 4b. The supervised ANN techniques and the unsupervised SOM
techniques were used in 40% and 8% of the reviewed studies,
respectively. Multivariate methods were applied for soft-sensor
design in 36% of the publications, divided in particular in PLS
(12%), PCA (22%) and PCR (2%) techniques. Moreover, neuro-fuzzy
methods were used in 7% of the publications.
The most applied methods used for different tasks in the
continuous and batch processes in the studies conducted after the
year 2005 have been collected in Table 5. Even though the popularity of the modelling methods among the research published
during the recent years does not mean that the considered methods
would be superior compared with the others methods, it gives a
hint for which tasks and process types these methods have been
found to be adequate. The FFNNs have been by far the most popular
methods proposed for the estimation tasks, corresponding for 58%
and 50% of the recent studies concerning the continuous and batch
processes, respectively. Other popular methods for the prediction
tasks in the publications dealing with the continuous processes
have been ANFIS and various PLS approaches. Different PCA techniques have been applied in 57% of the studies targeting for process
monitoring in the continuous treatment process after 2005. Among
them, the APCA variants have been the most popular. As for the
monitoring of the batch processes, the MPCA approach has been
employed in 60% of the recent papers. In the limited number of
papers where sensor monitoring has been studied, the researchers
have used various PCA methods in the continuous processes in 71%
of the works reported after the year 2005. None of the reviewed
publications targeted for sensor monitoring in SBRs.
Due to the dynamic and nonlinear nature of the wastewater
characteristics and treatment process conditions, the conventional
linear multivariate techniques have often been found to be unsatisfying methods for soft-sensor development in the wastewater
sector as such. Therefore, a number of adaptive and nonlinear PCA

and PLS extensions have been proposed and shown to be more
feasible for soft-sensor design in the reviewed papers. In particular,
adaptive PCA and PLS approaches based on, e.g., moving window or
recursive techniques have been demonstrated to overcome the
difculties associated with the changing process conditions, however, with an increased computational cost. An additional challenge
in the adaptive methods based on the moving window techniques
is the choice of an adequate time window length. As for the
nonlinear extensions, researchers have established, for instance,
FPLS and KPLS to be adequate for prediction tasks in biological
WWTPs. On the other hand, in all the case studies the performance
of nonlinear methods has not been shown superior to the simpler
linear methods. In those cases, employing the simpler methods is
suggested due to their lighter computational burden. The researchers have also indicated the multiway extensions of PCA and
PLS useful, in particular, for the monitoring and analysis of SBRs,
and found the multiscale approaches to extract the features of
treatment processes in different time-scales. In addition, the conventional and multiway PCA methods have been popular preprocessing techniques applied in 10% of the ANN-based soft-sensors proposed in the studies, which indicates the potential of the
PCA techniques in the compression of information.
In the publications where the performances of multivariate and
supervised ANN methods have been compared for prediction tasks
in WWTPs, usually the ANN methods have been found to be more
feasible. Especially FFNNs with various architectures and backpropagation training algorithms have been popular among the
soft-sensor developers. Even though in most of the case studies the
FFNN estimates in the biological plants have been shown accurate,
some drawbacks of the methodology have been notied. Those
include the extent of the training data required and the challenges
in simulating outputs outside the range of the training data. For
instance, the FFNN estimates resulting only in satisfactory accuracies due to an insufcient amount of training data has been reported in several publications. Moreover, the structure of the ANNs
is not easily interpretable and, therefore, they are not very useful
for learning interactions between the process variables. Another
challenge with FFNN modelling is dening the topology of the
network, which is often done based on trial and error. In addition to
the supervised ANNs, the researchers have applied unsupervised
SOM models successfully for monitoring, analysis and preprocessing tasks in a number of publications.
In several case studies, neuro-fuzzy models such as ANFIS have
outperformed the supervised ANN models when tested for prediction accuracy in the dynamic conditions of WWTPs. Also, the
structure of ANFIS may be easier to interpret than, e.g., the structure of FFNNs due to the IF-THEN rules, but a drawback of the ANFIS
methodology is a strong computational power required. Hybrid
models, where different modelling methods are fused on the system level, have been shown to be efcient tools for soft-sensor
tasks in many of the reviewed publications. Particularly, the
hybrid techniques have been indicated to enhance the strengths of
the individual modelling methods and to overcome their limitations. The features, pros and cons of the basic data-derived
methods used for soft-sensor design in the reviewed publications
are summarized in Table 6.
5.3. Factors limiting the use of soft-sensors and needs for the future
research
Even though full scale WWTP data has been used in most of the
case studies, only a small minority of the publications reported a
practical implementation of the proposed methods (see Tables 2e
4). This implies that many of the studies have been done mainly
for academic purposes. In other words, there is still clearly a gap to

be narrowed between the motivations of academia and the needs
of the people working in the plants. This problematic is discussed,
e.g., in a recent subjective review by Olsson (2012). It is likely that
especially in the smaller plants where the number of the technically educated employees is lesser, a limiting factor for soft-sensor
implementations is the insecurity caused by unfamiliar solutions.
In such cases, it may feel more condent for the operators to rely on
the conventional hardware sensors and their maintenance provided by the instrument suppliers when available. Instead, if the
plant operators have more technical competence and they are
research-orientated, it is more likely that they are open-minded for
novel techniques such as soft-sensors. In the best situations, the
operators are actually involved in the soft-sensor development,
they have recognized problems that can potentially be solved by
soft-sensing and, therefore, they are willing to test and implement
these techniques (see e.g., ijl and Lumley, 2006; Cecil and
Kozlowska, 2010). Another issue that limits the use of dataderived soft-sensors often lies with the education of the engineers who specialize in water and wastewater treatment. Even
though huge amounts of data are measured in the modern WWTPs,
the current curricula in many universities ignores statistical and
articial intelligence techniques that would be useful in handling
the data. The reports on the successful soft-sensor implementations in WWTPs will most likely be the best promotion for these
techniques and increase the interest of plant engineers and consultants to adopt the data-driven technologies. However, it should
be borne in mind that for practical solutions, the soft-sensing
techniques need to be applied in such a way that their use is
straightforward for the operators in order to make the soft-sensors
attractive.
Based on these considerations, the future research targeting for
practical implementations of soft-sensors in WWTPs would be
important for increasing the awareness of these alternatives to the
conventional measurement and monitoring solutions. The research
related to soft-sensors should also follow the development of the
state-of-art hardware sensors, concerning their dependability,
feasibility and expense, and the typical measurements used for the
process control. Thus, the primary variables whose measurement
reliabilities may be bottlenecks in the efcient process operation
can be recognized along the technical development that will take
place. Based on this knowledge, soft-sensors for the relevant applications can be designed. Moreover, the research should focus on
solving the real-life problems in WWTPs rather than developing
complicated methodologies motivated by theoretical interests. This
is also to say that the soft-sensor solutions should be selected based
on the problem at hand and they should be relatively simple.

6. Conclusion
In this review, we focused on data-derived soft-sensor
applications in biological wastewater treatment facilities. After

introducing briey the treatment processes used in the reviewed
case studies and the typical characteristics of process data in
WWTPs, a general guideline for soft-sensor design was provided.
The presented soft-sensor applications were divided into prediction, process monitoring and process fault detection, and sensor
monitoring categories according to the main objectives of the softsensor design.
To summarize, the data-driven soft-sensors have become more
popular as a greater number of real-time measurements have been
applied in municipal and industrial WWTPs. Typical soft-sensor
applications in the treatment plants include the prediction of the
primary process variables that are hard to measure reliably or with
reasonable costs using hardware instrumentation. Often, these
types of soft-sensors are proposed for estimating the concentrations of nutrients or organic matter. Due to the increased amount of
real-time process measurements, monitoring individual process
variables has become troublesome using, for instance, univariate
control charts. Hence, applications where a large amount of data is
compressed into visual low-dimensional monitoring tools that are
informative and easy to interpret has become valuable for plant
operators for the recognition of the operational states. Another
purpose of the data-driven soft-sensors is hardware instrumentation monitoring and providing a back-up system during instrument
down-time.
The data-derived techniques typically used for soft-sensor
design in wastewater treatment include different multivariate
statistical and ANN methods. According to the reviewed studies,
the conventional approaches of PCA and PLS are usually not able to
satisfactorily catch the dynamic and nonlinear behaviour of the
biological WWTPs. For this reason, the adaptive and nonlinear
extensions of multivariate methods have been proposed for
modelling treatment processes in many of the recent studies. As for
the batch processes, multiway PCA and PLS have been widely used
methods. ANNs, in particular the FFNN methods employing backpropagation learning algorithms, have been the most popular
techniques applied for data-driven soft-sensor development in the
reviewed publications, especially for estimation tasks. In addition,
neuro-fuzzy systems and hybrid methods have become more
common in wastewater treatment modelling applications.
