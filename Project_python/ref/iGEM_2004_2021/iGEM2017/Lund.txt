Lund:::Europe:::Sweden:::Environment:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::Construction of a tripartite split-GFP biosensor for detection of microplastics:::In light of the recent discussions regarding the realisation of the UN development goal number 14 concerning the conservation and sustainable use of marine resources, iGEM Lund has set out to aid in the world-wide engagement against microplastic pollution. Microplastic pollution is an ever-growing problem that stems from wasteful lifestyles with propagating adverse effects throughout the entire food chain. Upwards of 10 million metric tons of plastic has been estimated to enter the ocean every year. Participating in the iGEM competition for the first time, team Lund intends to rapidly and accurately determine the presence of microplastics through the design and implementation of a genetic circuit into E. coli. A logic AND-gate will be constructed utilising the conformational change of a heterologously expressed hER-alpha to associate a split fluorescent reporter.:::2017
