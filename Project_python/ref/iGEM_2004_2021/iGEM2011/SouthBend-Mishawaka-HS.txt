SouthBend-Mishawaka-HS:::North America:::United States::: :::High School:::Accepted:::Pseudomonas Psniff'r Light:::The bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an ubiquitous environmental pathogen that is one of the top three causes of opportunistic human infection. Often it is found in water, soil, skin flora, and most man-made environments. It is a frequent cause of infections such as pneumonia, swimmer’s ear, urinary tract infections (UTIs), and bacteremia. Because of the increasing severity of this pathogen, we are creating a device to detect it. We are using E. coli as the base of our machine. It detects P. aeruginosa by quorum sensing factors and reports using the gene for Green Flurorescent Protein. Ultimately, we would like to create a device that detects and measures the glow to determine, not only if P. aeruginosa is present, but also an approximation of the concentration. We would like to have a small, handheld device like the glucometer shown in the picture to the right.:::2011
