CBNU-Korea:::Asia:::Korea, Republic Of:::Software Tools:::Collegiate:::Accepted:::BUGS(Brick and Unique minimal Genome Software):::We have developed two distinct software tools. The first tool, MG-designer, is functionally divided into designer and viewer. The viewer shows the information of genomes in both linear and circular form. So it is easier for users to understand the characteristic of genomes. By the designer, user can design minimal genomes by essential genes which are analogized by our team in this year. The minimal genome can be designed depending on characteristics of species by inserting the function of genes into particular locations. With the second tool, brick-designer, user can design new bio-bricks. It is also able to synthesize bricks by using the bricks registered in partsregistry. User can also utilize bricks he just designed. We tried to enhance software potability by enabling the bricks to save as Genbank and SBOL types. Brick also can be saved as picture file so that it is helpful in the Wiki implementation.:::2012
