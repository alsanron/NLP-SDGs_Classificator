Proportion of resources allocated by the government directly to poverty reduction programmes. Proportion of total government spending on essential services (education, health and social protection). Create sound policy frameworks at the national, regional and international levels, based on pro-poor and gender-sensitive development strategies, to support accelerated investment in poverty eradication actions. Proportion of government recurrent and capital spending to sectors that disproportionately benefit women, the poor and vulnerable groups. End poverty in all its forms everywhere. Extreme poverty has been cut by more than half since 1990. Still, around 1 in 10 people live on less than the target figure of international-$1.25 per day. A very low poverty threshold is justified by highlighting the need of those people who are worst off. SDG 1 is to end extreme poverty globally by 2030. That target may not be adequate for human subsistence and basic needs, however. It is for this reason that changes relative to higher poverty lines are also commonly tracked. Poverty is more than the lack of income or resources: People live in poverty if they lack basic services such as healthcare, security, and education. They also experience hunger, social discrimination, and exclusion from decision-making processes. One possible alternative metric is the Multidimensional Poverty Index.
