as of december 2018, over 24 million km2 (17.2 per cent) of waters under national jurisdiction (0200 nautical miles from a national border) were covered by protected areas, a significant increase from 12 per cent in 2015 and more than double the extent covered in 2010. the global mean percentage of each marine key biodiversity area covered by protected areas increased from 31.2 per cent in 2000 to 44.7 per cent in 2015 and to 45.7 per cent in 2018. illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing remains one of the greatest threats to sustainable fisheries, the livelihoods of those who depend upon them and marine ecosystems. a framework of international instruments has been developed that addresses different aspects of fisheries management. most countries have taken measures to combat such fishing and have adopted an increasing number of fisheries management instruments in the past decade. for example, the agreement on port state measures to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, the first international binding agreement to combat such fishing, entered into force in june 2016. the number of parties to the agreement has rapidly increased and stood at 58 as of february 2019. small scale fisheries are present in almost all countries, accounting for more than half of total production on average, in terms of both quantity and value. to promote small scale fishers access to productive resources, services and markets, most countries have developed targeted regulatory and institutional frameworks. however, more than 20 per cent of countries have a low to medium level of implementation of such frameworks, particularly in oceania and central and south asia.
