An estimated 3.8 billion people still do not have access to the Internet, representing 80% of the population in the least developed countries. 3 billion people worldwide lack access to basic sanitation and 3 in 10 people lack access to safely managed drinking water. How much progress have we made? The growth of manufacturing in both developing and developed regions slowed in 2018, attributed largely to emerging trade and tariff barriers that constrain investment and future expansion.  The disparities in industrial productivity between rich and poor nations also remain stark. Why should I care? Inclusive and sustainable industrialization, together with innovation and infrastructure, can unleash dynamic and competitive economic forces that generate employment and income. They play a key role in introducing and promoting new technologies, facilitating international trade and enabling the efficient use of resources. The growth of new industries means improvement in the standard of living for many of us. Also, if industries pursue sustainability, this approach will have a positive effect on the environment. Climate change affects all us. What is the price of inaction? The price is steep. Ending poverty would be more difficult, given the industrys role as a core driver of the global development agenda to eradicate poverty and advance sustainable development. Additionally, failing to improve infrastructure and promote technological innovation could translate into poor health care, inadequate sanitation and limited access to education. How can we help? Establish standards and promote regulations that ensure company projects and initiatives are sustainably managed. Collaborate with NGOs and the public sector to help promote sustainable growth within developing countries.
