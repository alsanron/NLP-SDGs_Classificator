PARTNERSHIPS: WHY THEY MATTER. Strong international cooperation is needed now more than ever to ensure that countries have the means to achieve the SDGs. Whats the goal here? To revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. Why? In 2015, world leaders adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that aims to end poverty, tackle inequalities and combat climate change. We need everyone to come together, governments, civil society, scientists, academia and the private sector, to achieve the sustainable development goals. Why does this matter to me? We are all in this together. The Agenda, with its 17 Sustainable Development Goals, is universal and calls for action by all countries, both developed countries and developing countries, to ensure no one is left behind.
