How many people go hungry? The number of people going hungry has increased since 2014. An estimated 821 million people were undernourished in 2017. The prevalence of undernourishment has remained virtually unchanged in the past three years at a level slightly below 11 per cent. This reversal in progress sends a clear warning that more must be done and urgently if the Sustainable Development Goal of Zero Hunger is to be achieved by 2030. Why are there so many hungry people? Climate-induced shocks, civil insecurity and declining food production have all contributed to food scarcity and high food prices. Investment in the agriculture sector is critical for reducing hunger and poverty, improving food security, creating employment and building resilience to disasters and shocks. Why should I care? We all want our families to have enough food to eat what is safe and nutritious. A world with zero hunger can positively impact our economies, health, education, equality and social development. Its a key piece of building a better future for everyone. Additionally, with hunger limiting human development, we will not be able to achieve the other sustainable development goals such as education, health and gender equality. How much will it cost to achieve zero hunger? We will need an estimated additional $267 billion per year on average to end world hunger by 2030.
