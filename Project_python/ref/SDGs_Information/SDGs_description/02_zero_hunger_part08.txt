The proportion of undernourished people worldwide increased from 10.6 per cent in 2015 to 11.0 per cent in 2016. This translates to 815 million people worldwide in 2016, up from 777 million in 2015. In 2017, 151 million children under age 5 suffered from stunting (low height for their age), 51 million suffered from wasting (low weight for height), and 38 million were overweight. Aid to agriculture in developing countries totalled $12.5 billion in 2016, falling to 6 per cent of all donors sector-allocable aid from nearly 20 per cent in the mid-1980s. Progress has been made in reducing market-distorting agricultural subsidies, which were more than halved in five yearsfrom $491 million in 2010 to less than $200 million in 2015. In 2016, 26 countries experienced high or moderately high levels of general food prices, which may have negatively affected food security. Efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition have advanced significantly since 2000. Ending hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition for all, however, will require continued and focused efforts, especially in Asia and Africa. More investments in agriculture, including government spending and aid, are needed to increase capacity for agricultural productivity. The proportion of undernourished people worldwide declined from 15 per cent in 2000-2002 to 11 per cent in 2014-2016. About 793 million people are undernourished globally, down from 930 million people during the same period.
