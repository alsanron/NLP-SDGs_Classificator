NO POVERTY: WHY IT MATTERS. Why is there so much poverty in the world? Poverty has many dimensions, but its causes include unemployment, social exclusion, and high vulnerability of certain populations to disasters, diseases and other phenomena which prevent them from being productive. Im not poor. Why should I care about other peoples economic situation? There are many reasons, but in short, because as human beings, our wellbeing is linked to each other. Growing inequality is detrimental to economic growth and undermines social cohesion, increasing political and social tensions and, in some circumstances, driving instability and conflicts. Can we actually achieve this goal? Yes. To end extreme poverty worldwide in 20 years, economist Jeffrey Sachs calculated that the total cost per year would be about $175 billion. This represents less than one percent of the combined income of the richest countries in the world. So what can I do about it? Your active engagement in policymaking can make a difference in addressing poverty.
