in 2016, an estimated 155 million children under 5 years of age were stunted (too short for their age, a result of chronic malnutrition). globally, the stunting rate fell from 33 per cent in 2000 to 23 per cent in 2016. southern asia and sub saharan africa accounted for three quarters of all stunted children that year. in 2016, an estimated 52 million children under 5 years of age worldwide suffered from wasting (with a low weight for their height, usually the result of an acute and significant food shortage and/or disease). the global wasting rate in 2016 was 7.7 per cent, with the highest rate (15.4 per cent) in southern asia. at the other end of the spectrum, overweight and obesity affected 41 million children under 5 years of age worldwide (6 per cent) in 2016. ending hunger demands sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices. one aspect of that effort is maintaining the genetic diversity of plants and animals, which is crucial for agriculture and food production. in 2016, 4.7 million samples of seeds and other plant genetic material for food and agriculture were preserved in 602 gene banks throughout 82 countries and 14 regional and international centres, a 2 per cent increase since 2014. animal genetic material has been cryoconserved, but only for 15 per cent of national breed populations, according to information obtained from 128 countries. the stored genetic material is sufficient to reconstitute only 7 per cent of national breed populations should they become extinct.
