Micro-organisms and invertebrates are key to ecosystem services, but their contributions are still poorly known and rarely acknowledged. By 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements. By 2020, promote the implementation of sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests and substantially increase afforestation and reforestation globally. By 2030, combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and strive to achieve
