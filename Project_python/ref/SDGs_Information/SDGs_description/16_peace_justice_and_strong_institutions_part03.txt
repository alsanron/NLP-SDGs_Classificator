Ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels. Broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global governance. By 2030, provide legal identity for all, including birth registration.

Strengthen relevant national institutions, including through international cooperation, for building capacity at all levels, in particular in developing countries, to prevent violence and combat terrorism and crime. Promote and enforce non-discriminatory laws and policies for sustainable development. PEACE, JUSTICE, AND STRONG INSTITUTIONS: WHY THEY MATTER. Today, 20 million people are refugees, over 41 million people have been internally displaced, and at least 4 million people are stateless. Whats the goal here? Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. Why? Peaceful, just and inclusive societies are necessary to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). People everywhere need to be free of fear from all forms of violence and feel safe as they go about their lives whatever their ethnicity, faith or sexual orientation. In order to advance the SDGs we need effective and inclusive public institutions that can deliver quality education and healthcare, fair economic policies and inclusive environmental protection. What needs to be done to address this? To achieve peace, justice and inclusion, it is important that governments, civil society and communities work together to implement lasting solutions to reduce violence, deliver justice, combat corruption and ensure inclusive participation at all times.
