The proportion of the worlds workers living with their families on less than $1.90 per person a day declined significantly over the past two decades, falling from 26.9 per cent in 2000 to 9.2 per cent in 2017. Based on 2016 estimates, only 45 per cent of the worlds population were effectively covered by at least one social protection cash benefit. In 2017, economic losses attributed to disasters were estimated at over $300 billion. This is among the highest losses in recent years, owing to three major hurricanes affecting the United States of America and several countries across the Caribbean.

In 2013, an estimated 767 million people lived below the international poverty line of $1.90 a day  down from 1.7 billion people in 1999.
