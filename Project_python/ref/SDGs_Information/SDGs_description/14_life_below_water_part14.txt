as reflected in the United Nation Convention on the Law of the Sea, for the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans and their resources. Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Sustainable Development Goal 14 aims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. Effective strategies to mitigate adverse effects of increased ocean acidification are needed to advance the sustainable use of oceans. As areas of protected marine biodiversity expand, there has been an increase in ocean science funding, essential for preserving marine resources. The deterioration of coastal waters has become a global occurrence, due to pollution and coastal eutrophication (overflow of nutrients in water), where similar contributing factors to climate change can affect oceans and negatively impact marine biodiversity.Without concerted efforts, coastal eutrophication is expected to increase in 20 per cent of large marine ecosystems by 2050. The Preparatory Meeting to the UN Ocean Conference convened in New York, US, in February 2017, to discuss the implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14. International law, as reflected in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), stressed the need to include governance instruments to consider anthropogenic activities taking place outside of the ocean. Concerns regarding ocean health in destructive fishing practices and marine pollution were discussed, in looking at the role of local communities of small island developing States (SIDS) and least developed countries (LDCs) to not forget that oceans are a large part of their economies. The targets include preventing
