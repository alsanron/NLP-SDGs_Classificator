ON LAND: WHY IT MATTERS. 1 million plant and animal species are at risk of extinction. Whats the goal here? To sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, halt and reverse land degradation, and halt biodiversity loss. Why? Forests cover nearly 31 per cent of our planets land area. From the air we breathe, to the water we drink, to the food we eat, forests sustain us. Around 1.6 billion people depend on forests for their livelihood. Almost 75 per cent of the worlds poor are affected directly by land degradation. Forests are home to more than 80 per cent of all terrestrial species of animals, plants and insects. However, biodiversity is declining faster than at any other time in human history. An estimated 20 per cent of the Earths land area was degraded between 2000 and 2015. Biodiversity and the ecosystem services it underpins can also be the basis for climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies as they can deliver benefits that will increase the resilience of people to the impacts of climate change. Forests and nature are also important for recreation and mental well-being. In many cultures, natural landscapes are closely linked to spiritual values, religious beliefs and traditional teachings. What would it cost to correct the problem? The UN Forum on Forests Secretariat estimates that achieving sustainable forest management on a global scale would cost US$70-$160 billion per
