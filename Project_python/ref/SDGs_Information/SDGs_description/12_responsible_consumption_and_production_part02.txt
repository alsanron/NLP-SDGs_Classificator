be required to provide the natural resources needed to sustain current lifestyles. With rises in the use of non-metallic minerals within infrastructure and construction, there has been significant improvement in the material standard of living. The per capita material footprint of developing countries increased from 5 metric tons in 2000 to 9 metric tons in 2017. 93% of the worlds 250 largest companies are now reporting on sustainability. Water. Less than 3 per cent of the worlds water is fresh (drinkable), of which 2.5 per cent is frozen in the Antarctica, Arctic and glaciers. Humanity must therefore rely on 0.5 per cent for all of mans ecosystems and fresh water needs. Humankind is polluting water in rivers and lakes faster than nature can recycle and purify. More than 1 billion people still do not have access to fresh water. Excessive use of water contributes to the global water stress. Water is free from nature but the infrastructure needed to deliver it is expensive. Energy. If people worldwide switched to energy efficient lightbulbs, the world would save US$120 billion annually. Despite technological advances that have promoted energy efficiency
