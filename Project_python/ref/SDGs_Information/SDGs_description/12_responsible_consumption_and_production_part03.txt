gains, energy use in OECD countries will continue to grow another 35 per cent by 2020. Commercial and residential energy use is the second most rapidly growing area of global energy use after transport. In 2002 the motor vehicle stock in OECD countries was 550 million vehicles (75 per cent of which were personal cars). A 32 per cent increase in vehicle ownership is expected by 2020. At the same time, motor vehicle kilometers are projected to increase by 40 per cent and global air travel is projected to triple in the same period. Households consume 29 per cent of global energy and consequently contribute to 21 per cent of resultant CO2 emissions. The share of renewable energy in final energy consumption has reached 17.5% in 2015. Food. While substantial environmental impacts from food occur in the production phase (agriculture, food processing), households influence these impacts through their dietary choices and habits. This consequently affects the environment through food-related energy consumption and waste generation. Each year, an estimated 1/3 of all food produced  equivalent to 1.3 billion tons worth around $1 trillion  ends up rotting
