If the global population reaches 9.6 billion by 2050, the equivalent of almost three planets will be required to sustain current lifestyles. What is the goal here? To ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns. Why? Economic and social progress over the last century has been accompanied by environmental degradation that is endangering the very systems on which our future development and very survival depend.  If we dont act to change our consumption and production patterns, we will cause irreversible damage to our environment. What are some of the current consumption and production patterns that need to change? There are many aspects of consumption that with simple changes can have a big impact on society as a whole. For example, about one third of the food produced for human consumption each year is lost or wasted. When it comes to consumers, households consume 29 per cent of global energy and contribute to 21 per cent of resultant CO2 emissions. Water pollution is also a pressing issue that needs a sustainable solution. We are polluting water faster than nature can recycle and purify water in rivers and lakes. Urgent action is needed to ensure that current material needs do not lead to over-extraction of resources and further degradation of the environment. How can I help as a business? Its in businesses interest to find new solutions that enable sustainable consumption and production patterns. A better understanding of environmental and social impacts of products and services is needed, both of product life cycles and how these are affected by use within lifestyles.
