inclusive and sustainable economic growth can drive progress and generate the means to implement the sustainable development goals. globally, labour productivity has increased and unemployment is back to pre financial crisis levels. however, the global economy is growing at a slower rate. more progress is needed to increase employment opportunities, particularly for young people, reduce informal employment and the gender pay gap and promote safe and secure working environments to create decent work for all. in 2017, the global growth rate of real gdp per capita was 1.9 per cent and is expected to remain at about 2 per cent from 2018 to 2020. this is significantly less than the 3 per cent rate attained in 2010 and slightly higher than the 2015 rate of 1.63 per cent. real gdp growth rate for least developed countries is expected to increase from 4.5 per cent in 2017 to 5.7 per cent in 2020, which is less than the 7 per cent envisioned by the 2030 agenda. since the global economic downturn of 2009, labour productivity (measured as gdp per employed person) has been increasing in the world, recording positive annual growth rates consistently since 2010. in 2018, the world’s labour productivity increased by 2.1 per cent, its highest annual growth since 2010. informal employment, which has an impact on the adequacy of earnings, occupational safety and health and working conditions, remains pervasive: in three quarters of countries with data on the subject, more than half of all persons employed in non agriculture sectors are in informal employment. based on data for 62 countries, the median hourly gender pay gap stood at 12 per cent. the median gender pay gap exceeded 20 per cent in managerial and professional occupations, among workers in crafts and related trades and among plant machine operators and assemblers.
