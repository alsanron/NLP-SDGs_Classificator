planetary warming continued in 2016, setting a new record of about 1.1 degrees centigrade above the preindustrial period, according to the world meteorological organization (wmo) statement on the state of the global climate in 2016. drought conditions predominated across much of the globe, aggravated by the el niã±o phenomenon in the statement, wmo also noted that the extent of global sea ice fell to a minimum of 4.14 million km2 in 2016, the second lowest extent on record. atmospheric carbon dioxide levels also reached a record high of 400 parts per million that year. mitigating climate change and its impacts will require building on the momentum achieved by the paris agreement on climate change, which entered into force on 4 november 2016. stronger efforts are needed to build resilience and limit climate related hazards and natural disasters. parties to the paris agreement are expected to prepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions. the nationally determined contributions reflect official country responses to climate change and contributions to global climate action. as of 20 april 2017, 143 parties ratified the paris agreement, of which 137 parties (136 countries and the european commission) communicated their first nationally determined contributions to the secretariat of the united nations framework convention on climate change. as of 20 april 2017, seven developing countries successfully completed and submitted the first iteration of their national adaptation plans, in response to climate change. developed countries have committed to jointly mobilizing $100 billion per year by 2020 to address the climate related needs of developing countries and to continue that level of support through 2025. initial efforts to mobilize resources for the green climate fund raised $10.3 billion and developed   country parties are strongly urged to scale up their financial support.
