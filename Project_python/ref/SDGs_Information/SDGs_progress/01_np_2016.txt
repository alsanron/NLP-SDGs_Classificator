goal 1 calls for an end to poverty in all its manifestations by 2030. it also aims to ensure social protection for the poor and vulnerable, increase access to basic services and support people harmed by climate related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters. the international poverty line is currently defined at $1.90 or below per person per day using 2011 united states dollars purchasing power parity (ppp). in the decade beginning in 2002, the proportion of the world’s population living below the poverty line dropped by half, from 26 per cent to 13 per cent. if growth rates during those 10 years prevail for the next 15 years, the global extreme poverty rate will likely fall to 4 per cent by 2030, assuming that growth benefits all income groups of the population equally. however, if the growth rates over the longer period of 20 years prevail, the global poverty rate will likely be around 6 per cent. in other words, eliminating extreme poverty will require a significant change from historical growth rates. in 2015, 10.2 per cent of the world’s workers were living with their families on less than $1.90 per person per day, down from 28 per cent in 2000. young people are especially likely to be among the working poor: 16 per cent of all employed youth aged 15 to 24 were considered working poor, compared to 9 per cent of adults. expanding social protection programmes and targeting appropriate schemes to the poor and most vulnerable can further reduce poverty. social protection programmes include social assistance, such as cash transfers, school feeding and targeted food assistance, as well as social insurance and labour market programmes, including old age pensions, disability pensions, unemployment insurance, skills training and wage subsidies, among others.
