Even before the pandemic, the pace of global poverty reduction was decelerating, and it was projected that the global target of ending poverty by 2030 would be missed. The pandemic is pushing tens of millions of persons back into extreme poverty, undoing years of progress. While the pandemic has highlighted the need to strengthen social protection and emergency preparedness and response, those measures are insufficient to safeguard the poor and the vulnerable, who most need them.
After a decline, from 15.7 per cent in 2010 to 10.0 per cent in 2015, the pace of reduction of extreme poverty slowed further, with a nowcast rate of 8.2 per cent in 2019. The pandemic is reversing the trend of poverty reduction. According to the most recent estimates, the global extreme poverty rate is projected to be 8.4 to 8.8 per cent in 2020, which is close to its level in 2017. Consequently, an estimated 40 to 60 million persons will be pushed back into extreme poverty, the first increase in global poverty in more than 20 years.
The share of the world’s workers living in extreme poverty fell, from 14.3 to 8.3 to 7.1 per cent in 2010, 2015 and 2019, respectively. Progress in that regard was less encouraging for young workers: in 2019, 12.8 per cent of the world’s young workers lived in extreme poverty, compared with only 6 per cent of all adult workers. The pandemic is pushing millions of workers into unemployment, underemployment and working poverty.
Based on 2016 data, 55 per cent of the world’s population, about 4 billion persons, did not benefit from any form of social protection, which is critical to help the poorest and the most vulnerable in the current crisis. At least half of the world’s population still lacked full coverage of essential health services, and only 22 per cent of unemployed workers were covered by unemployment benefits.
Hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, wildfires and other extreme natural disasters exacerbate poverty. A total of 80 countries reported disaster-related losses for 2018, including 23,458 deaths and 2,164 persons missing. More than 39 million persons were reported as affected, 29 million of whom saw their livelihood disrupted or destroyed. In terms of direct economic losses, $23.6 billion was reported by countries, 73 per cent of which was attributed to the agricultural sector.
