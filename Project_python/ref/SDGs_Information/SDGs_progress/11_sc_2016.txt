more than half the world’s population lives in cities. by 2030, it is projected that 6 out of 10 people will be urban dwellers. despite numerous planning challenges, well managed cities and other human settlements can be incubators for innovation and ingenuity and key drivers of sustainable development. however, as more people migrate to cities in search of a better life and urban populations grow, housing issues intensify. already in 2014, 30 per cent of the urban population lived in slum like conditions; in sub saharan africa, the proportion was 55 per cent, the highest of any region. globally, more than 880 million people were living in slums in 2014. this estimate does not include people in inadequate or unaffordable housing (defined as costing more than 30 per cent of total monthly household income). as population growth outpaces available land, cities expand far beyond their formal administrative boundaries. this urban sprawl can be seen in many cities around the world, and not only in developing regions. from 2000 to 2015, the ratio of the land consumption rate to the population growth rate in eastern asia and the oceania was the highest in the world, with developed regions second. other regions, such as south eastern asia and latin america and the caribbean, showed a decrease in that indicator over the same time period. globally, urban areas are expanding at a faster rate than their populations. between 2000 and 2014, areas occupied by cities grew 1.28 times faster than their populations. closely related to this trend is that the urban densities of cities have been declining, creating profound repercussions for environmental sustainability at the local, regional and global scale. better management of urban growth will be crucial in order to guarantee sustainable urbanization.
