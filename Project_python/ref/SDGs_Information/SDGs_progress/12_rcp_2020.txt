worldwide consumption and production, a driving force of the global economy, rely on the use of the natural environment and resources in a model that continues to lead to destructive impacts on the planet. the pandemic offers countries an opportunity to build a recovery plan that will reverse current trends and change consumption and production patterns towards a sustainable future. as at 2019, 79 countries and the european union reported on at least one national policy instrument that contributed to sustainable consumption and production in their efforts towards the implementation of the 10 year framework of programmes on sustainable consumption and production patterns. global domestic material consumption per capita rose by 7 per cent, from 10.8 metric tons per capita in 2010 to 11.7 metric tons in 2017, with increases in all regions except northern america and africa. however, domestic material consumption per capita in europe and northern america is still 40 per cent higher than the global average, indicating the need to enhance resource efficiency and practices to reduce consumption in the future. the global material footprint rose, from 73.2 billion metric tons in 2010 to 85.9 billion metric tons in 2017, a 17.4 per cent increase since 2010 and a 66.5 per cent increase from 2000. the world’s reliance on natural resources continued to accelerate in the past two decades. the montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer has been universally ratified by 198 parties, and, as a result of its implementation, the overall abundance of ozone depleting substances in the atmosphere has decreased over the past two decades, with projections to return to 1980 values in the 2030s for northern hemisphere mid latitude ozone. from 2010 to 2019, global e waste generation grew continuously, from 5.3 kg per capita to 7.3 kg per capita, while the environmentally sound recycling of e‑waste increased at a slower pace, from 0.8 kg per capita to 1.3 kg per capita.
